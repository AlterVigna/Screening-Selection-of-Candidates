Abdalsalam Almzayyen,1,0,12,8.16,1,1,3,0,0,0,"I LOVE Video Games.

I always thought my dream was to be a doctor, it was always my plan to end up doing that even though I was double majoring with computer engineering. But little did I know it was only a distraction from my real dream, the one that started as a young kid playing video games. I decided to create my own game, which introduced me to the world of computers and programming so early on because it was what I needed to make my own games. Thus started my journey and passion for coding, working on small projects starting with Visual Basic as my first language and working my way to being a Software Systems engineer. 

I love viewing reality as a video game, and programming helps me to better understand it and create the reality I want very easily and simply. It is an extremely satisfying and beautiful art, turning simple characters into creations like my own video game, applications that change the whole world, and that just scratches the surface with the infinite possibilities available.

My specialties include problem solving, quickly learning new skills and programming languages, systems design, computer systems and Linux kernel programming. However as you know video game development always comes on top ;) Doctor of Philosophy - PhD; Associate’s Degree; Bachelor's degree;  Research And Development Specialist.

Aaron Black,1,0,9,3.15,0,1,3,4,2,0,"I work with teams of physicists, computer scientists, and applied mathematicians on high performance, massively parallel, multi-physics simulation codes.

The majority of my time is spent assisting code teams with refactoring their algorithms and code infrastructure to take advantage of the heterogenous architecture in the Sierra supercomputer, sited at LLNL.  Sierra is one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, rated at 120-150 petaflops.

Work is also progressing on adapting these codes to run on the next generation of supercomputer, El Capitan.  This architecture will provide NNSA with it's first exascale system, providing a 10x performance jump over Sierra.

If you are interested in a career or a summer student internship working on some of the fastest supercomputers in the world, on the bleeding edge, feel free to contact me or check out our jobs site at http://jobs.llnl.gov Bachelors; Masters (incomplete); Computer Engineering;  HPC Software Architect. Advanced Architecture and Portability Specialists Team (AAPS), Deterministic Transport Code Team

The AAPS team is tasked with assisting code groups across LLNL with evolving their codes to run on next generation architectures.  This position is very challenging, but also very rewarding, and something I had wanted to do ever since attending the ATPESC training at Argonne and hearing about their Catalyst team HPC architects.

I managed efforts on two teams engaged in porting their respective code projects to the GPU's for Sierra and El Capitan.  The first is a thermal radiative transfer code and the second is a hydrodynamics code.  Each code base presents unique challenges in where their algorithm performance lies and technical challenges we are facing.  Further complexities arise when these code bases are compiled into the same executable to run a hydro + transport physics problem.  These codes are written in C, C++, and Fortran and use technologies such as OpenMP, CUDA, ROCM.  The job entails heavy use of profiling tools and understanding the available parallelism and memory vs compute performance balance of the algorithms.

I currently split my time between HPC work and general software engineering work.  We're currently working on standing up a new simulation code using high order transport methods.  High order solutions show a lot of promise of mapping well to GPUs.. Software Engineer Team Lead. KULL Project

I found being a team lead a great learning experience for developing many soft skills in team interaction, technical leadership, and managing team personnel.  My project manager was a superb mentor in providing tips and advice on effectively managing people.  I ended up stepping away from this role to allow me more time to pursue developing my skills in the HPC architecture area.. Software Engineer. I've worked on a variety of parallel multi-physics simulation codes written in C, C++, Python, and Fortran.  These codes typically use a bulk synchronous, domain decomposed parallel model ( as opposed to asynchronous task based ) and employ MPI (off-node communication) and OpenMP (on-node).

My first eight years at LLNL was spent on the hydrodynamics code 'KULL' which used a python frontend for problem steering, and a heavily templated C++ backend.. Software Engineer. Embedded programming using C++ on media devices.

I don't recall the exact start month on this job, this is an estimate.   This was a part-time position while I was taking my Master's classes.  Good team of people.. Consultant. Worked on a contract for NASA to replace their legacy financial systems with SAP R/3 modules.  Our four person team's main task was setting up and running a help desk to provide support during  the roll-out of each module.  The contract also included post-rollout support until the help desk procedures were finalized and the needed NASA personnel were trained and familiar with the system.  At the end of the contract, we handed over the help desk to long-term personnel.

Booz Allen's performance was lauded by NASA personnel at Dryden on this software rollout.  The previous contracted company had over-run the budget and failed to deliver on their developer software system.. Independent Consultant. Started my own company as a computer consultant.  I built and sold computers, linux web servers, and troubleshooted software and hardware issues.  I found the experience of running your own business a challenging, but very valuable learning experience.. Software/Web Developer. Worked on a four person team developing the nAct product, an intranet pre-press workflow solution.  nAct used a distributed computing approach, using workstations as print process servers and an nAct server to monitor and  control jobs and process queues using Internet Explorer as the GUI.   Product was built on html, javascript, jsp, CORBA, and SQL.. Support Technician, Web Developer. Typical desktop and networking support position in a university.
- Troubleshoot and install desktop products, networks, etc, for Windows and Macs.
- Moderate level of HTML work for university intranet.. Quality Assurance Software Engineer. Software quality assurance engineer at Seagate, working on the Seagate Backup Exec product.

This software group went through a few different companies over my career - Arcata, Seagate, and now owned Veritas Software.

The testing methodology at Arcata was pretty unorganized, mostly ad-hoc testing, or repetitive testing of test suites by hand, and testing using the full product only (no underlying testing framework to remove the gui element).  The team consisted primarily of part-time college students and a few career level people.

During my time there, we vastly improved the testing practices to include an automation lab, an actual test harness that could be scripted, white box testing, driver testing, and increasing the involvement of SQA's in the development process.  It was still a bit behind typical companies when I left, but it was a great learning experience (and challenging) to push these changes through the company culture and practices, and educate developers on the importance of total quality management..  Implemented trial of LLNL RAJA portability layer for MIC/GPU/OPENMP/CUDA in KULL hydrodynamics code for BG/Q platform.

More info at:
http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/raja-managing-application-portability-next-generation-platforms. LLNL is developing a code called MARBL, which is their new next generation multi-physics application code for simulating high-energy-density physics.  I've been working on a variety of areas in this project - a simulation data repository components called 'sidre' (2016), restart/checkpoint capability in the hydrodynamics package BLAST, and other deliverables where needed.  For 2017 I'm focusing more on MFEM ( high order finite element library ).  The high order fem is providing a promising approach for providing more compute and less memory transfer ( ideal for GPU's and newer architectures ).. KULL Project

KULL is a multi-physics, high performance, parallel simulation code modeling High Energy Density Physics problems.

The majority of this code is written in C++, with heavy use of generic programming, templating, and modern C++ concepts.  We have a steering and control layer written in Python and our C++ assets wrapped using SWIG and PyBindgen.  It is a massively parallel code, using MPI and OpenMP to achieve runs scaled out to a million cores.

I held several roles on this project over my 9 years there- a senior software engineer role, computer science team lead role, and an informal software architect role.

These roles overlapped, but the architect role dealt more with migrating the code to challenges 5-10 years out.  In this informal role I found increasing opportunities to work with people outside my project to collaborate on shared challenges facing all the code groups, including code groups from other labs.  One multi-project effort I had the opportunity to work on was evaluating an abstraction layer for our codes for-loops that could sit on top of CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP, etc.  This approach allows us to mitigate the risk of adopting any one vendor solution or needing to write separate kernels for each architecture.

Another unique opportunity I was part of was developing the computer science requirements for a brand new LLNL multi-physics parallel simulation code designed for next generation hardware.  This later led to me taking a position on the new code project and reducing my time to 50% on the KULL project.

I continued to deliver code features but my remaining time was typically reserved for leading small team efforts or individual code work requiring deeper domain knowledge of the infrastructure or physics packages.  I also continued to mentor newer team members and provide direction for  threading work by the team.. I'm coordinating a team and implementing a port of a radiation transport FORTRAN code (TETON) to CUDA Fortran and OpenMP 4.5, for the upcoming LLNL Sierra supercomputer.

Designed multiple methods of image encryption / decryption that were coded in an Eclipse environment.. Online Social Networks (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) have dramatically grown in usage and become popular in recent years. In addition to keeping track of friends and acquaintances, these networks provide a powerful means of exchanging and sharing information on many different topics of interest (e.g., sports, religion, politics, health concerns, etc.). Moreover, the use of these networks has introduced a completely new way of collaboration among people, virtually creating spheres of friends who generally feel comfortable discussing a variety of subjects and even helping each other to grow in knowledge about certain subjects. Therefore, people have been attracted to becoming a part of these spheres. 
In this thesis, we build and analyze networks of social groups on Twitter related to the topic of certain diseases. We considered 13 health conditions that are categorized as the top leading causes of death in the United States and tracked any message that mentioned at least one of these health conditions. To define a relation between Twitter users and create a network, we used the concept of \textit{time window} where the focus is on a particular period of time. In the process of reconstructing social structures related to each one of the health conditions, we assigned different lengths to a time window.
The argument was that social connectivity might be retrieved even in cases where users are not directly talking to each other. However, by analyzing and evaluating our networks based on three basic characteristics of social networks: degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, we found that the networks we extracted do not have all the characteristics of typical social networks and only 1% of them have the scale-free characteristics; yet some do which leads us to argue that our approach should be further investigated..

Purpose: speed up incident resolution process for users and eliminate the need for employees to personally resolve incidents. Data Analyst Intern. My team and I integrated a sensor system by attaching color and temperature sensors to an Arduino and connecting the Arduino to a Raspberry Pi; sensors were planted in barley fields, and data was relayed from the Raspberry Pi. We constructed a data collection and reporting system using Google Firebase to store data and JavaScript to display real-time updates of the sensor readings. Applying machine learning techniques, we created predictive modeling functions for several barley diseases by utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas Dataframes (to access the data), and Matplotlib and Numpy (to model data).. Summer Research Intern. My team and I depicted the number of microbes in the gut microbiome by modifying a base model (the Lotka-Volterra model); this is an important part of finding cures to various gastrointestinal diseases. We modelled data from mouse gut microbiome by using Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) to find a correlation between the relative rank and relative abundance of microbes in the gut..  I implemented breadth-first search and depth-first search iteration techniques to traverse through a PNG pixel by pixel.  By modifying the hues of select pixels while iterating, I created a GIF..

Intel Edison kit comprises of a powerful 22 nm SoC (system on chip) with an atom core and multiple sub systems. We implemented several functions.. Had done a research project on machine learning of high dimensional data using random projections. This is an applied computational theory project based on a generalization of Johnson-Lindenstrauss algorithm, proposed by Prof. Sharath Raghavendra from Virginia Tech. As a part of this project, I implemented k-mean clustering using reduced dimensions, k-means streaming, and coreset implementation to understand the algorithm proposed.. The main purpose of this project is to place the boxes optimally and efficiently in a single container. We applied a discrete optimization method GH5E (greedy heuristic with five evaluations). This project is under the framework of 'Distributing Industrial Optimization Tasks to Rural Workers' under the collaboration between the University of Strathclyde and IIIT Allahabad. Final deployment would be at several rural BPO offices to show that industrial tasks can be outsourced to rural workers providing a sustainable source of skilled employment.

Advisor: Dr. Anupam Agarwal. This project is an extension of the project ‘Hybrid Intelligence Approach for 3D Bin Packing Problem’ with more than one container. The project is based on AI and ML techniques. The aim of the project is to place different kinds of boxes into different kinds of containers while maintaining high volume utility with minimum leftovers.

Analysis of complex performance data obtained from large scale parallel simulations: Performed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of performance data and simulation output to identify performance bottlenecks.. Graduate Research Assistant. Current Research: 
Large-scale parallel data analysis algorithms for scientific simulations:
  - Developed large scale parallel topological analysis techniques for in-situ (on-the-fly) topological feature extraction of scientific simulations by adding less than 1% overhead and a 10x increase in analysis frequency
  - Developed a C/C++/MPI-based library for parallel topological analysis of scientific simulations that is scalable to 16,000 nodes (256,000 CPU cores) and deployed on the world’s fastest supercomputers (previous known implementation scaled to only 4,000 cores)
  - Developed theoretical proofs and formal descriptions of above techniques requiring theoretical understanding of topology concepts

Past Research:
Analyzing and visualizing performance data obtained from profiling massively parallel simulation codes executed on supercomputers
- Developed a data visualization tool called Boxfish to visualize network traffic on a supercomputer interconnect using Python, PyOpenGL that helped design better communication strategies for parallel applications. System Software Engineer. Worked on the CUDA profiler team. 
Responsibilities involved developing functionality in the CUDA driver (like exposing hardware performance counters and GPU machine code instrumentation of CUDA kernels) to support key profiler features. 

Gained deep understanding and knowledge of the GPU architecture, and CUDA performance optimizations.. Intern. Worked as a part time intern in the Video Team during last year of undergraduate program.

Developed a Windows application using C/C++/CUDA that performed intelligent scaling (resizing) of digital photographs to reduce the space required to store photographs

Developed a hand gesture recognition system:
- Created a hand gesture image database of about 9000 images with various gestures
- Ported object classification routines from OpenCV to CUDA in order to accelerate the classifier training process - reduced training time from several days to withing a day
- Enabled real time interaction with the computer/laptop using a webcam and hand gestures.  Present day scientific simulations rely heavily on extremely powerful compute resources for their computation needs. These resources are typically supercomputers with hundreds of thou- sands of CPU cores. Analyzing the performance of these simulations becomes a complex task given the sheer complexity and size of these supercomputers. Conventional methods for an- alyzing the performance of these systems include profiling the simulation code and collecting hardware metrics like flop counts, cache hits/misses, branches taken, etc. from the cores. But with today’s architectures, one can collect quite a wide range of hardware metrics from every compute core, generating a complex dataset of performance metrics. Analyzing this dataset for optimization guidelines becomes a difficult task even for performance experts.
In this project, we analyze the performance of simulations by observing the relations between two data sets - the performance metrics, and the output of the simulation. Understanding the interdependence of these two data sets leads to a better understanding of the behavior of these complex simulations on these large machines. To find correlations between these two datasets we take help of Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) to understand which performance metrics are most correlated to the features in the simulation output. We demonstrate how our analysis helps in making important inferences about the performance behavior of the MIRANDA simulation on the IBM BlueGene/P system at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.. In the area of deploying machine learning systems, Domain Adaptation is an important task which we encounter in real world. Here the goal is to build our model based on some fixed source domain and then deploy it to one or more different target domains. In many applications, it is expensive and time consuming to collect labeled training samples. On the other side, classifiers trained with only a limited number of labeled patterns are usually not robust. In practice, the computational cost for domain adaptation will grow fast as the data sets become larger and more unlabelled data is cheaply available.
In this paper, we consider a semi-supervised domain adaptation technique named DTMKL(Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Learning) which can learn robust classifiers with only a limited number of labeled patterns from the target domain by leveraging a large amount of labeled training data from other auxiliary(which we call source) domains. Under the framework of DTMKL, we propose an approach based on intelligent sampling on the unlabeled data which reduces the running time without any significant impact on accuracy..

When a patient arrives at a clinic, the MedConnect mobile app scans his/her Aadhar card and retrieves all the related past medical data. The medical personnel posted in the local clinic, or other authorized personnel can have access to all this data while making a diagnosis for a particular patient through a web dashboard. This data gets stored in a centralized server and can be accessed by a medical personnel with access even if the patient travels outside his local region.

Other features include:

The dashboard can be used to give various insights including what types of diseases are common in a region and adjoining areas, thus deciding what stock of medicines should be available in stock at nearby medical stores. Insights can also be gained towards preventing epidemics.

It can also provide analysis and visualizations about various classes of diseases and can help in tracking their sources.

The mobile application also indicates whether a particular villager can take benefit of a government policy ('Yojna') to avail medicare benefits.. Taking a bus?

The model also allows hosting as a service model where an untrusted client can query data from an untrusted publisher who gets paid for amount of data retrieved.. This project was funded by Office of Naval Research. A poster on the same topic was a finalist at RSA conference 2020. 

A paper is under review at USENIX Security 2020.. Interactive multiplayer gaming has always been an active area of development. However, most games rely on external devices for input, such as a keyboard, mouse, PS4 controllers, etc. These devices support a limited set of actions including button presses or joystick movements and are often lacking motion-sensing capabilities. In addition to this, most of these devices are expensive ($50-$60). Smartphones on the other hand are ubiquitous and consist of a rich set of sensors that let users control and interact with the environment. In our research, we show how a smartphone can be used as a low-latency input device for playing real-time multiplayer games. We show that information from smartphone sensors can be used to do basic motion sensing. Our method allows users to perform natural actions, such as steering a wheel, as opposed to keypresses while playing racing games in order to provide a more immersive gaming experience.. In this work, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to learn a policy for buffer management. In particular, we propose a Q-Learning based framework focusing on page replacement task for predictive workloads. During the execution of a workload and when the buffer is full, our system proposes a page in the buffer for eviction. Our system learns from past execution and creates a generalized, easy to implement a solution that databases can adopt. Our simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in certain cases suggesting the benefit of bringing modern learning-based techniques into traditional database system design.

Aadi Swadipto Mondal,1,0,5,3.15,1,1,2,1,0,0,"I am currently working on DNS A records under Professor Paul Barford, UW Madison. My primary interest lies in Computer Systems, especially Networking and Security. I have two publications (IEEE CEC 2020 and AAAI 2021 Student Abstract) on CNN Evolution and Algorithmic Bias. Besides these, I am an Android and Web Developer. I interned in Honeywell Bangalore, India as a Software Developer, where I worked on ReactJS and InfluxDB. Feel free to have a look at Care4U, an android app for elderly care, covered by several Indian media houses. Bachelor of Technology - BTech; Master of Science - MS;  Research Assistant. Empirical analysis of DNS structure, behavior and performance using novel data sets and techniques.  The goal of this work is to develop broad and novel perspectives on DNS that lead to improvements in the systems and protocols used to configure, manage and secure the underlying infrastructure.  This work is being done in collaboration with Prof. Paul Barford (UW Madison), Prof. Mark Crovella (BU) and Prof. Joel Sommers (Colgate).. Android Developer Internship. We developed an android app for on-ground surveys by agents, containing features like an attendance management system, online form submission with location tracking, reimbursement management system. The app is pretty smart to detect fraud cases, like using simulators with fake GPS to mark attendance. We took the help of the Safety Net Attestation API for this. The language and architecture used were Kotlin and Model-View-View-Model(MVVM) architecture along with View Binding for compile-time binding class generation of XML layouts. Network calls were made using Retrofit via HTTPS requests, and the Android Room Database for offline storage of data. Firebase Cloud Storage was used to store files like images in a systematic order.. Software Developer Internship. We developed a visualization platform of time-series data from Atlassian JIRA using Grafana. My job was to built custom visualizations as plugins for Grafana using ReactJS. The data was scraped using python scripts and stored in InfluxDB. This internship introduced me to the Agile Methodology of Software Development where we deployed regularly on the Continuous Integration Continuous Development (CICD) pipeline. The pipeline consisted of Atlassian Bit-bucket, Octopus, and Open-Shift. This experience also taught me Docker containers and Kubernetes, used during deployment in the CICD pipeline.. Undergraduate Researcher. We designed a language model based on BERT using python-PyTorch and Transformers library to systematically attach sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and seven pre-defined aspect labels (Technical Issues, Usability, Content, User Interaction, Feature Request, Learning Qualities, Advert) to the scrapped app reviews from the Google Play Store. We then compared the user dispositions of apps from five different app categories (AR, VR, Educational, Educational AR, EducationalVR) to analyze the effectiveness and quality of AR/VR for education in the form of android apps compared to the traditional norms and techniques.. Web Head of Inter IIT Sports 2019 Core Committee. I led a team of 10 students to develop a website for operation management of the Inter-IIT Sports Meet 2019 that happened in IIT Kharagpur. We designed the front-end using ReactJS and back-end using Django with MongoDB as database. The team also featured an android app which was made with Flutter, having similar features to that of the website. They featured registration of students and staff members, live-score of ongoing matches, automated ranking system, mess management of participants, etc. This was one of the first live web projects I had worked on, used by some thousands of students for conducting a successful Inter-IIT Sports Meet..  Developed a mobility-aware multi-agent simulation-driven method for estimation of COVID-19 spread which intrinsically takes care of factors like a mutation of virus strains, asymptomatic cases, and other latent conditions. Created a human mobility simulation of 1.38 billion people in India to estimate the amount of testing needed under different scenarios..

Currently, I'm growing in a leadership capacity as a Test Team Lead for a group of 8 Test Engineers.
* I interpret complex requirements and provide guidance, direction, and feedback to the team on test procedure development, execution, and troubleshooting.
* Additionally I plan and develop extensive, formal test plans for both component and system test efforts.

Historically I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer on several web-app projects.
* My passion is for front-end software development using Angular, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create streamlined user experiences that target the client's needs and expectations.

Additional Notes: I am also interested in taking a look outside the DoD sector into the private industry where there is more freedom for creativity and the ability to use new technologies.  I also believe I can decipher requests from non-technical clientele well and build out beautiful and functional designs using sound architecture principles.  I have a strong degree of empathy to work well with a variety of personalities to see a problem from other people's points of view.  As such I would also be interested in exploring small team lead positions.

Montana Tech allowed me to channel my interest in the various aspects of electrical engineering: from Power Systems and Control Systems to Electronics and Wireless Communication, and allowed me to create, collaborate, and complete a wide range of projects. 

Now that I’m graduating soon I’m looking forward to the next chapter in my life; a career where I can apply my passion for my field and be an active and valuable contributor.

When I’m not working on a project or hunched over a textbook, I’m usually off-roading in the mountains, or in my garage working on fixing and restoring an older truck (Love those late 60’s Chevy’s). I enjoy watching sports, especially football, play video games, and travel whenever I get the chance.

Modified a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning framework for the task of monocular depth and camera motion estimation from unstructured video sequences. The baseline model uses fully convolutional neural networks to simultaneously train the estimation of motion relative to a rigid scene and the estimation of depth using the structure of a target scene. Rather than using ground truth for training, the baseline uses novel view synthesis as a supervisory signal.
Our modified approach attaches a Mask R-CNN to segment images into different objects. We incorporate an additional loss function promoting depth gradients around object segments to sharpen our depth maps around object boundaries.

Aaron Goss,1,0,6,21.92,0,1,1,1,0,0,"I am recently working as a Service Reliability Engineer with VMware's Cloud Monitoring Service development teams.  In this role, I work closely with our development teams to provide AWS, Kubernetes and Cloud-based infrastructure support and development, troubleshooting SaaS solutions running in AWS, investigating and supporting CICD pipelines,and promoting best-practices for services being adopted into our SaaS ecosystem.

In this role, I invest time in automation of service support (e.g. deploy, configuration), as well as provide additional assistance to the infrastructure monitoring team, designing and implementing applications, services, and utilities for monitoring Cloud-based services.

I spend a large amount of my spare time working in Python, utilizing technologies such as Flask and SQLAlchemy to build web-based applications  I'm also growing in my familiarity in upcoming languages, including Rust, Go, and Haskell.  My passion is software development with a focus on Cloud-based technologies, such as Kubernetes and Linux containers.

Specialties: Kubernetes, Docker, SaaS, Java 8+, Scala 2.12, Gradle, Maven, Java EE, Spring, Java Pluggable Annotation Processing API, Web-based APIs, SOAP, REST, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Database Design and Administration, Python, Python + Qt (i.e. Pyside), Python + Flask and SQLAlchemy, GUI development, software testing and quality control, test automation and development process, Object-oriented design, metaprogramming, data visualization, minor experience in Javascript, Linux/Unix system administration, network administration BS;  Staff Engineer I. My previous position with VMware has been as an Operations Development engineer, working closely with our support group and customers, investigating immediate issues, and triaging customer installations. I also work with our organization to investigate, prioritize, and implement features for existing product, in accordance with customer needs. As an operations engineer, my work includes Java, Python, and extensive shell scripting (primarily Bash), working primarily with Linux systems.

Accomplishments:
* Designed and implemented Docker-based product analysis platform, executing utilities across a variety of languages/technologies for exposing defects in customer environment
* Designed and implemented Kubernetes-based SaaS version of the same product analysis platform
* Designed and implemented extensive Python-based troubleshooting library

The system required a detail analysis of learning process and how the behavior of human thinking changes based on various factors, in order to change the difficulty level of the quiz.. Devised a new algorithm that deals with encryption keys that can be used for future transactions.

For every point-to-point conversation, the system generated four different keys at different instances and exchanged few by encrypting them with the rest and detected the encrypting keys with the help of dummy packets.

As the conversation progressed, the system kept updating the keys after every sent/received message using different mathematical functions on both sides, thus avoiding the need of sharing keys again for the newly formed keys.. Developed a model for complex sound generators by individually synthesizing and discretizing the objects that contribute to the generation of sounds. 

The system could generate sounds that are beyond human’s caliber and repetitive tones continuously, like the ones used in ‘Trance’. We conducted a wide range of tests to try different frequencies, sample rates and channels in order to generate an array of sound.. Implemented an access structure, called multi-layered synopsis, as an abstract layer on Apache Spark Framework that automatically generates internal tables over a database to improve the throughput and response time of SQL queries. 

The structure skips portions of table that don’t contain rows of interest resulting into I/O reduction during sequential or index scans, read optimization and eliminates storage costs associated with indexes.

The structure was tested over 2.3 million records generated from TPC-H benchmark and was observed to be more beneficial for largely grouped or nearly ordered data like web logs and financial transactions.. Worked on a Yale Dataset which has 165 64x64 pi images, each image being a face, and is sorted as a MATLAB file.

My journey as a college student didn't start off as a Computer Science major but fate landed me in an ""Introduction to Python Programming for Non-major"" class in my Freshmen year. Every time I used to sit in the class time used to pass away so quickly and I enjoyed every minute of it. My professor was amazing and she made learning everything seem so simple. That's when I decided to make the big shift. The journey so far had been extremely challenging but I would trade it for nothing.

As a CS major in my junior year, I am extremely passionate about analyzing and interpreting large data sets and use my results to develop solutions to challenging problems.

The process of slogan creation by humans involves finding key concepts of the company and its products, and developing a memorable short phrase to describe the key concept. We attempt to follow the same sequence, but with an evolutionary algorithm. A user inputs a paragraph describing describing the company or product to be promoted. The system randomly samples initial slogans from a corpus of existing slogans. The initial slogans are then iteratively mutated and improved using an evolutionary algorithm. Mutation randomly replaces words in an individual with words from the input paragraphs. Internal evaluation measures a combination of grammatical correctness, and semantic similarity to the input paragraphs. Subjective analysis of output slogans leads to the conclusion that the algorithm certainly outputs valuable slogans. External evaluation found that the slogans were somewhat successful in conveying a message, because humans were generally able to select the correct promoted item given a slogan.. Various deep learning architectures such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long short term memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN) have been applied to fields such as natural language processing, speech recognition and computer vision where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results. But these advance models have not yet been applied in the context of Nepali language. Trivial problems like automatic recognition of a small piece of a handwritten document is still a challenging task in Nepali. So, we want to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models to recognize handwritten Nepali characters. This might convince researchers to explore these deep models which in turn will help to expand research on Nepali language. After careful analysis of different hyper parameters, we choose four layers deep network with 1024 hidden units in each layer. We achieved 90.18\% accuracy in a test set against 72.3\% accuracy obtained using simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). This result shows a significant improvement above all other methods reported. This trained model can be used for any general purpose application which involves recognizing Nepali characters effectively.. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great promise in solving difficult learning task, and achieved above human level performance in promising tasks like Atari games, Go and poker. RL has two broad classes of algorithms: Actor and Critic, with their own merits and demerits. This paper explores the benefits of combining them into Actor-Critic algorithms and demonstrates their ability in solving classic control problems. We use temporal difference learning class of algorithms as critic and policy gradient as actor. Our implementation of Actor-Critic algorithms was able to solve the classic Cartpole problem in 96 time steps. As these algorithms are model-free, it can be use to solve almost any type of RL problems with very few tweaks.. This motivation of this project was to compile chapters so that it could be useful for upcoming students in control theory. Different topics in each chapter were divided among the students in CS 712R and as a final project all the chapters were combined to form a book on Control Theory. Specifically I worked on the Dissipative systems chapter of the book along with Dynamical Structure Functions, Lyapunov Functions and stability criteria. I this this book would be useful for students who want to study Control theory with a broader perspective.. Social animals cooperatively transport object which is many times bigger than themselves effectively. Mimicking those behaviors on real robots will have diverse applications in engineering, health care and search and rescue. In this paper, we define different categories of cooperative transport problems and discuss different tools and techniques to tackle them. We then show that occlusion-based cooperative transport techniques are effective when the object is convex and there are enough agents to overcome frictional force. Results show that even with only two robots, the occlusion-based technique is able to transport objects 60\% of the time.. Current computer vision algorithms using Neural Nets with softmax function can only classify objects in between the labels used for training. If we provide the algorithm with the entirely different image still it will try to classify the image for the labels it knows. It would be amazing if these algorithms could distinguish between the images which are similar to what it has seen before and which are completely different. This problem is known as Open Set recognition problem. Addressing this problem would be tremendous benefits for computer vision as machines will be able to classify the objects more accurately and more robust to fooling images as well as adversarial images. We implement OSDN algorithm using Weibull fitting in the penultimate layers of Neural Nets to address the issue with Open Set recognition problem.. Cryptography and data science research grew exponential with the internet boom. Legacy encryption techniques force users to make a trade-off between usability, convenience, and security. Encryption makes valuable data inaccessible, as it needs to be decrypted each time to perform any operation. Billions of dollars could be saved, and millions of people could benefit from cryptography methods that don’t compromise between usability, convenience, and security. Homomorphic encryption is one such paradigm that allows running arbitrary operations on encrypted data. It enables us to run any sophisticated machine learning algorithm without access to the underlying raw data. Thus, homomorphic learning provides the ability to gain insights from sensitive data that has been neglected due to various governmental and organization privacy rules.In this paper, we trace back the ideas of homomorphic learning formally posed by Ronald L. Rivest and Len Alderman as “Can we compute upon encrypted data?” in their 1978 paper. Then we gradually follow the ideas sprouting in the brilliant minds of Shafi Goldwasser, Kristin Lauter, Dan Bonch, Tomas Sander, Donald Beaver, and Craig Gentry to address that vital question. It took more than 30 years of collective effort to finally find the answer “yes” to that important question.. It is crucial not only to understand the specialized sub-system of an autonomous vehicle like lane detection, vSLAM, and traffic light detection to build a safe and reliable self-driving car, but understanding the subsystem interaction with each other is equally important. So for our CS704R project, first, we independently implement those specialized subsystems. Second, we combine those modules to build a minimal self-driving car agent in ROS. Finally, we test our agent in a simulated highway environment. Our minimal agent was successful in driving on the highway track..

Teaching assistant for Data Structures (ECS 36C), Theory of Computation (ECS 120), and Probability Theory/Statistical Modeling (ECS 132). Undergraduate Researcher. Research Area: Computational Geometry. Chair, Computer Science Tutoring Committee. .  Implemented a CPU Simulator using C++ that relied on the Intel x86 Architecture for its design. Simulated many parts of the CPU such as Memory Cache, Decoder, Control Unit, ALU and Floating Point Unit. Read in Assembly Language files with multiple operations and simulated the CPU Registers after every operation. Also implemented a memory system that could hold both Instructions and data.. Built a simple processor that was 8 bits wide, in Logisim, that could do various register transfers and ALU operations over a common bus. Designed nine 8-bit registers to keep track to various ALU operations. Used a 32 X 24 RAM Module with separate load and store ports to store MIPS instructions, which was then passed to multiple components within the CPU to change these registers. Also designed a 5 bit synchronous program counter to contain the address of current instruction being executed by the CPU.. Designed an efficient C++ program that simulated the New York Stock Exchange by attempting to match buyers to sellers for each stock. Each buyer specifies the number of shares of a stock, and the highest price per share he is willing to pay. Each seller specifies the number of shares, and the lowest price per share he is willing to accept. 
Followed ‘Felsman’s Rule’ for matching price per share transactions between buyers and sellers. The program was efficient enough handle a 1,000,000 offers and 1000,000 buyers and sellers.. Wrote an efficient program in C++ that determines the minimum blood flow pattern for a brain. Given a list of brain cells and how blood vessels connect them, starting from the carotid artery, and ending with the jugular vein, my program will determine how much blood should flow between connected brain cells during a series of pulses until all the brain cells have received at least one full blood cell. Made use of Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine shortest path between two brain cells.. Wrote grading scripts in BASH that graded simple C/C++ programs based on correctness and design. The script would generate a results file and would email the result to the user. Also wrote a separate script that would check for correctness of indentation for C/C++ Files.. Collaborated with 3 other people to create a web app that allows people/patients to write about their day. The system then analyzes and generates data visualization for monthly and daily reports. Made use of IBM Watson (AlchemyAPI) for Sentimental and Emotional Analysis. Used Python and Flask to make the back-end. Used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and D3.js to make the front-end. This app won the best hack that made use of IBM Watson at Hack Davis 2017.

MY ROLE: I worked on the Back-End. I used Python and Flask to write scripts that parsed and retrieved data from JSON Files generated by IBM Watson's Sentimental Analysis.. Built a 5-stage pipelined MIPS CPU with hazard detection, branch prediction, and forwarding, using Logisim. As an added challenge, the CPU is built in Logisim simply through the use of AND, OR, NOT gates, including all multiplexers, decoders, and registers.

Evaluated an AES module implemented on FPGA and compared its correctness and performance with OpenSSL cryptographic library on linux platform. It involved the study and development of test benches and host interface modules using a python based hardware description language(MYHDL) and an in-house developed FHPClib framework.. Summer Intern. During this internship, I did RF survey, 2G ARFCN planning for Mohali(using MCOM software and Ericsson engineering tool), 3G planning for Mohali, 4G backbone planning(TEMS 17.x software used for drive testing and network optimization) and 4G network simulation(using Cisco Packet Tracer software).. Trainee. In this training, I learned the basic image processing tools in MATLAB, color detection technique, Object tracking and the GUIDE tool..  It’s a basic project using 555 timer IC and IR sensor. The 555 IC is used in bistable
mode so whenever the voltage drops at the trigger pin(which is connected to IR
sensors), the output becomes high and a musical bell starts.. The basic idea of the project was to create a single battery powered WIFI module of the size of our fist which would transfer data from normal USB stick to any WIFI enabled device and act as a data sharing hub. This device can also be configured for sharing wireless Internet connection.. Detects the correct box using RFID and pick and place it at the desired location. Locomotion of vehicle is controlled using an android application which uses Bluetooth as a means of communication. The purpose of this project is automation of industry.. In this project, we have developed an architectural design of the Zigbee Transmitter through Verilog HDL. As the transmitter is an integration of various blocks, so each block has been individually simulated. The architecture has been simulated using post route simulations.. It was part of a freelancing project. In this project, I used the beautiful soup and scrapy library of python to scrape text from various national newspaper websites and save it in a database, which was used by the local newspaper agency to get its content automatically.. A 3x3 non-blocking virtual cut-through switching router has been designed and simulated on Xilinx Vivado.. Parallelized the radix sort algorithm with openMP and compared its performance with non-parallel radix sort algorithm.. Deployed a two-level cache hierarchy exhibiting LRU and LFU policies with
write-back and write-allocate.. Data path and control path with support for integer and floating point unit. Handled
Structural, control and data hazards.. LSTM cell is used in convolution neural networks. Fetched data from SRAM and performed mathematical operations - matrix multiplication, addition and truncation.

Junior Software Engineer at Nextiva Inc. primarily working with Spring, Hibernate for creating RESTful services and Maven for deployment on servers.

Software developer at Accenture with experiences SQL, PLSQL, macros, VbScript in telecom domain. Worked with experts from various countries ( Spain, India, South Africa)

Worked on android as an intern in Suven Consultants. Developed various android apps from opening built in apps to three tier architecture apps.

Technologies: Java, Android, Python, Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, C, C++, PHP, Macros, VbScript, Unix shell scripting Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.); Master's degree;  Junior Developer Intern. I started with understanding the product on which we are working. I attended trainings from the project owners regarding the products demo, about how things exactly work, Then I started going through code. Then I had clear understanding how MVC architecture is implemented in Nextiva, which packages what functionality. I started debugging the current project. I started with very basic get functionality. With the help of Chrome developer tools, I was able to find the requests made from Website to the controller. Using the Requests, I was able to find how data is encapsulated in object from the front end and passed to the controller. Once the Controller gets hit, I used my debugging skills to find out how does controller makes a call to Model. Then I started to work on my tasks. 

My tasks is to migrate our code from MVC to SOA, I started developing services for each and everything. So my primary work is focused around creating a RESTFul service’s for controller and Model. Following is the approach which I used for tasks. First, I create a Controller similar to old system but with different calls. Second, I develop a Service Implementation for Controller, which in turns call to respective Model service which it requires to access Model data in order to perform the operation. Third, I developed the Model Service which calls the Models Data Access Objects, which in turn provides the abstraction layer from the model to the outer controller. So if there is any change in Controller, one has to do no changes to the Model, it remains intact and it can also serve as Service API, which can be used for generating addition revenues. In order to test the functionality I created a Http Client which makes a REST calls and hits the Controller. Then I created a Junit function test which will call the client method to initiate the process.. CIS TA/Grader. Create Assignments, tests.

Responsibilities include setting up infrastructure & problems for assignments, grading quizzes and project milestones, proctoring, and holding office hours to clarify doubts and help improve student understanding of class content, designing data-centric projects & mentoring teams to innovate ideas in various domains..  Automation of cancerous cells in an image by passing it as an input to a trained classifier. The classifier was trained based on the feature extraction done from a database of approximately 200 images after image enhancement and segmentation. C# based application to automate build process for .Net Framework 2 and above applications, windows and web services using Team Foundation Server. After building the application, the health index is assigned to the application (based on various parameters like performance, coding style, security etc). It also allows user to release application from DEV environment to other environments like TEST, UAT, PROD etc based on certain criterias. 
The application also supported deployment of Sharepoint applications on servers.. Python based application focused to compare documents using a trained classifier using various techniques like tf-idf weights, mutual information, and representing its semantic information using VSM models.. An application to construct automatic summaries for given set of documents using two different techniques – Simple and Greedy Summarizer, and thus compares results of both the summarizers.. Project built on client-server model for creating defense system for an AR Drone based on authentications and IP tables and thus forcing incoming traffic to go through an authentication process. The later half of the project hacked the same using various hacking techniques like Buffer Overflow, Man-In-Middle Attack etc.. Python based supervised classifier to distinguish between information dense and non-information dense leads from new articles in various domains using a classifier trained on various lexical and syntactical feature sets.

Developed a multi-threaded HTTP Web Server similar to Apache Tomcat which is capable of running Java Servlets to serve static as well as dynamic web content. It accepts GET, HEAD and POST requests from the web browser and invokes a worker thread from a thread pool to process each request. Appropriate exceptions are thrown for Bad Request, File Not Found, File Not Accessible etc. Stress Testing was performed on the server using apache workbench. The server was able to serve 10000 request with 1000 concurrent requests.. Designed a XPath evaluation engine using a recursive descent algorithm developed in Java based on a predefined CFG. Also crawled web pages and and aggregates them as specified in XPath expression. Berkeley DB was used for persistent storage.. Designed a Master-Worker Hadoop style framework with single master node and multiple worker nodes. The master co-ordinates the workers, sends requests to different workers based on a hashing algorithm; the workers are in charge for running the map-reduce jobs and storing the data in the required format. The application has a status page in form of a User Interface which displays the list of currently active workers with details like workers IP address, status of worker (mapping/reducing/waiting etc). The status is updated periodically as the workers send information to the master node using REST form communication.. The motivation behind the application comes from the clogged mailbox with pamphlets showing the deals on pizzas or any restaurants, custom websites for each business ( like eating joints, coffee shops, bars, salons etc). Yelp like applications help user to take a decision based on business information but there is nothing available for businesses to attract users on the fly, help users with a hangout planner with daily basis deals. Thus, Urban Beats lets the business in your area know about the potential customer and let them share more customized deals on the fly.
The application was hosted on Heroku Server and database stored on Amazon instances. The technology stack includes - NodeJS on the backend with MySQL and REDIS on the backend, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquerry, Facebook API, GoogleMaps and Image Search API.
Link : http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis330/g4.html. Built a cloud based scalable search engine hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. The project comprised of the 4 main components - Distributed Mercator Style Web Crawler, Indexer and TF-IDF retriever, PageRanker and a Multi-threaded Search Engine with a UI. 
a. The Web Crawler crawled over 100,000 Web URLs and stored results in Berkley DB. The crawler was designed as a Master-Worker Model with coordination between amongst the 15 workers. It also followed Robots Exclusion Protocol.
b. The Indexer/TF-IDF Retriever and PageRanker was designed to run as Elastic MapReduce job and stored results on DynamoDB. The indexer in addition stored various important data related to the web pages like position of words, main tags, meta tags etc.
c. The Search Engine was a multi-threaded component with a user interface to retrieve pages ordered in a weighted manner based on results from Indexer and PageRanker.. Designed a machine learning model to predict success of movies based on their box office collection and critic rating. Developed various models using Naive Bayes, SVM, ADA Boost and Logistic Regression to investigate the effectiveness of each model on the predictions. Data sets of approximately 5000 feature films was gathered from various sources like MovieLens, RottenTomatoes, TMDb and Wikipedia to train two distinct models. Overall classification results and performance analysis were reported.. The focus of CodeScore was to give a quantifiable measure to a student’s coding ability which will allow programmers to get a simplified view of their coding quality in terms of adherence to coding standards based on Google Java Style Guide and Sun Code Conventions, and also measure the quality of a design in terms of its extensibility, reusability, and maintainability to manage package dependencies effectively. The open source tools CheckStyle and JDepend were used to achieve desired results.. Implemented a fully ordered multicast chat server in C++ with  a central sequencer/leader (chosen from among the current group members). The leader will be responsible for sequencing messages as well as determining who the current active clients are, detecting eliminating any inactive/crashed users from the chat (and making sure that the remaining clients have an up to date list of those currently in the chat). A new client can add to the system by sending request either to the leader or any active client. Each client will communicate with the leader from time to time. The chat server also allows to detect if the sequencer/leader has crashed or left the server and let current users run elections to get a new leader. Along with this, various failure recovery mechanisms are implemented, like message failure recovery, add/delete users when the join/exit/crash from the system, start/elect a new sequencer when he starts/exit/crashes from the create chat server..

NOVEC is a locally based and owned electric distribution system headquartered in Manassas, Virginia. NOVEC has installed substation automation devices that uses Fiber-optic telecommunications 
technology to communicate between substations and automation the process of electric usage data collection.
The growing application of data analysis and the way the technology is helping businesses grow makes NOVEC use the collected data to not only generate bills for each customer but to perform analysis on this data to forecast the electric usage using an ARIMA time series predictive model.
NOVEC being an electrical distribution system purchases electricity from the futures market helping them utilize the dynamic nature of the market to make a purchase at the best price. And for them to make a good purchase in ever-so changing market they need the prediction model to work spot-on.
NOVEC is currently facing some issues with the performance of this prediction model. The model that works spot-on under ideal conditions, seems to be much affected by sudden or drastic weather changes.
The objective of this project is to give NOVEC a perfectly working model under normal and not-so normal weather conditions without having to change their basic operations. The client was confident about the correctness of the model and feel changing the model might affect operations and wouldn’t want that unless absolutely, necessary. 
We decided to perform data conditioning to detect any anomalies or outliers that maybe be caused by an outage due bad weather conditions and might an algorithm that brings these outliers within the acceptable range of data. The objective of the developed algorithm is to condition the data to improve the overall data quality to ensure accuracy of the predictive data model.. Developed an interactive R Shiny App to visualize and analyze the changing trend in the homicide cases throughout all states of the USA. The project helps understand the changes over years for trend like choice of weapon, gender of victim and perpetrator for the last 34 years.. In face of a global slowdown in terms of placements and admissions, there has been a significant drop in recruitment of the MBA students since 2012, which in-turn lead to a decrease in institutes’ admissions turnover.
The aim of this data analysis project is to design an application that can help institutes keep the applicants to be admitted to the MBA program based on their chances of getting placed after obtaining the MBA degree. The data model was designed to have a strong Sensitivity score (students correctly predicted as placed) and few false negatives.
The project performs feature selection to design the data model for admission procedure for an A-class business school. We also performed data exploration of the dataset to identify underlying patterns and features that influenced the choice for specialization by the applicants. Lastly a prediction model was developed to shortlist the profiles of applicants for the MBA program.. Web scraped data from Yelp website is used to identify and analyze trends that fetches insights on the restaurant industry in USA. This project utilizes dataset compiled by the Yelp cooperation. We have performed data exploration to identify trends like the most preferred cuisine, the US state with highest reviews, most commonly served dishes etc. We performed sentiment analysis using the NLP techniques to classify these reviews as either positive or negative. These then labeled reviews are analyzed to identify the most liked and disliked features, that aids in deciding the must-have and must-not-have features of our restaurant.. The price of a house can’t be necessarily predicted by studying the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the height of the ceiling, the age of the property or even the extensive study of the neighborhood. A house that becomes a home of a family needs to tick off all the boxes. A house buyer considers a lot more than the statistics of the property before investing his/her hard-earned money into a dream house.
This project attempts to expand the house prediction model to predict the sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa by considering various parameters the house-buyer is most likely to consider. We also performed feature engineering to identify the key predictors that infulencxe the sale price of the house in the region. We have used the Ames housing dataset that consists of 79 explanatory variables i.e., 37 quantitative and 42 qualitative variables that describe almost every possible aspect of residential homes..

Our project was regarding emergency vehicle such as Ambulance, fire brigade. The idea behind this project was if an emergency vehicle stuck in heavy traffic then it becomes difficult for vehicle to move on, but by the help of our concept we can reduce the heavy traffic on that route and making clear road for vehicle, the person in that vehicle can control the traffic signal as per his rout up to the respective hospital. So it saves time and more important Life.    

My role was as a designer and programmer. I was mainly working on programming and interfacing of LED and more important I designed a new protocol for wireless transmission.. Components Used for LINE FOLLOWER ROBOT:

1. 8051 Micro-Controller
2. L293D (16 pin IC)
3. 2 X DC geared motors
4. 2 X wheels
5. 2 X IR sensors (module)
6. 7805 voltage regulator
7. 7V-8V Lithium Ion battery
8. Castor (3 wheel for support)
9. Chassis. HMI is operated with the Configuration software which is downloaded from internet via USB or RS-232 cable. Large production of HMI devices per day requires more PC’s. Our project reduces the interference of the PC in the downloading operation of this software, number of people required to do work is reduced and no skilled labor required too. Once the software is downloaded from PC to our downloader, it can be used several times with ease.  The downloader device is reprogrammable as per requirement of user. 
In our project, I designed a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) with the help of PCB express software and Orcad 9.1. Software. I also helped my team members in source code programming. We interfaced LED, LCD and Flash memory with the micro-controller LPC2292 (ARM 7TDMI).. Arbiter Specification: -

• It has one active LOW reset input
• It has 4 active HIGH data inputs, namely req3, req2, req1 and req0. Each of these inputs represents a request to the arbiter from a different hardware unit, for permission to access a common bus within a larger system.
• It has 4 active HIGH outputs, namely grant3, grant2, grant1, and grant0, each representing the status for the request arriving on lines req3, req2, req1 and req0, respectively. If only req3 = 1, then only grant3 = 1 and all the other outputs will be 0. If only req2 = 1, then only grant2 = 1 and all the other outputs will be 0.
For example, if grant3, grant2, grant1, and grant0 indicate values 1, 0, 0, 0 respectively, it means that the hardware unit that sent its request on the req3 input has been granted the permission to use the common bus.
• Only one of the 4 outputs can be HIGH at any given time
• If multiple data inputs are asserted, then priority is given to the highest numbered req input among the asserted inputs. For example, if req3 = 0, req2 = 1, req1= 1, req0 = 0, then only grant2 will be HIGH.
• The arbiter has an initial state where all outputs are LOW.. User Interface either consists of a web application or a mobile application through which the customer accesses the online store.It interacts with the Product search component to browse through the product catalog and even filter the results to match his/her needs. Once the user browses the product and it’s added to the cart, purchase management component takes over.
The customer can then make a purchase directly or store the products in the cart to which he can later decide to buy. Shopping cart service helps customer to either add, delete or modify existing items in the cart. The quantity of the available products are continuously updated from the database. Order service acts as a medium for the customer to make payment with the payment service. The payment service either accepts VISA or MasterCard.Database management acts as an interface that connects database to cart and order service.. Implemented the digital clock that displays time in hours, minutes and seconds blinks in between the hour and minute display. The objective of project is to implement all the basic functions of the digital clock which we find in our daily life routine. The features like 24 hour display, clock, clock setting, alarm setting, alarm alert indicator.. Basic Arithmetic functions and used carry look ahead for addition and booth’s algorithm for multiplication programmed using Verilog HDL with Test bench.. Motion detector program which detects moving objects from computer webcam & then it records time of object enter the webcam video frame and time the object exited from the video frame and save the time in .csv file. When you exit the program it will show the graph of time object entered in frame and existed from frame plotted by using Bokeh visualization tool. Application can work to detect the animals and people too.. The need of high speed multiplier is increasing as the need of high speed processors are increasing. A Multiplier is one of the key hardware blocks in most fast processing system which is not only a high delay block but also a major source of power dissipation. A conventional processor requires substantially more hardware resources and processing time in the multiplication operation, rather than addition and subtraction. We are implementing a high speed 4x4 bit Vedic Multiplier (VM) based on Vertically & Crosswise method of Vedic mathematics, a general multiplication formulae equally applicable to all cases of multiplication. It is based on generating all partial products and their sum in one step. The coding is done in HSPICE as well as simulation. The Power dissipation of 4x4 bit Vedic multiplier calculated as a baseline at 130nm technology node and compared with various low power techniques. We found that the in some techniques the delay is increasing but the power dissipation is reducing significantly. So we can use these circuits for power efficient devices.. •	Web-based information system designed to allow, view and maintain employee information throughout the year.

Check out the live demo on https://help-r2-d2-escape.herokuapp.com and check the console for useful logs about the search logic.

In this application, Search is used to help R2-D2 escape. The prison is an m × n grid of cells. Some of the grid cells are occupied by unmovable obstacles. Luckily for R2-D2, there is an inactivated teleportal (a device for instantaneous travel) in one of the grid cells that can take it to the rebel’s planet. However, R2-D2 can not use the teleportal to escape unless it is activated. To activate the teleportal, R2-D2 has to push big rocks onto pressure pads lying all around the grid. Each of the rocks and the pressure pads occupies a single cell in the grid. When all the pressure pads have rocks pushed on top of them, R2-D2 can head straight away to the activated teleportal to escape. R2-D2 can only move in the four directions (north, south, east, and west) and push rocks around, but it can not pass through or push the unmovable obstacles or the teleportal..

DLoc is a Deep Learning based wireless localization algorithm that can overcome traditional limitations of RF-based localization approaches (like multipath, occlusions, etc.). DLoc uses data from the mapping platform we developed, MapFind, that can construct location-tagged maps of the environment. Together, they allow off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices like smartphones to access a map of the environment and to estimate their position with respect to that map. During our evaluation, MapFind has collected location estimates of over 150 thousand points under 10 different scenarios across two different spaces covering 2000 sq. Ft. DLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Wi-Fi-based localization by 80% (median & 90th percentile) across the 2000 sq. ft. spanning two different spaces.. LocAP is an autonomous system to physically map the environment and accurately locate the attributes of existing wireless infrastructure in the physical space down to the required stringent accuracy of 3 mm antenna separation and 3 degree deployment orientation median errors, whereas state-of-the-art algorithm reports 150 mm and 25 degree respectively.. BluBLE is an initiative by researchers at WCSNG Lab UCSD, to help communities in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. We have been leading the research efforts in harnessing wireless signals to sense the environment and localize human beings in it. This aspect of localization of human beings opens up tremendous opportunities to effectively fight against the COVID-19 pandemic..

Keeping the code clean and organized is important to prevent bugs and to collaborate with others. Linters help identify possible errors and bad practices and formatters allow us to concentrate on the features without having to worry about the code format. Unfortunately, configuring and maintaining these tools is cumbersome and more often than not, the project ends up with incorrect configurations (if any at all).

The goal of Poetic is to simplify the setup and maintenance of code styling tools and rules while allowing full customization.

Aalayah Spencer,1,0,9,8.82,0,1,2,0,0,0,"Challenge driven undergraduate astrophysics student with experience in software development, instrumentation development, quality assurance and science communication.

I am a problem solver, eager and quick learner. As a researcher, I have built tools to gain insight from real world data as well as for future instrumentation proposals. My experiences have relied on computer programming primarily in Python with associated packages and building scientific instrumentation as well as on collaborations with diverse teams of engineers and scientists. Among these experiences, was my contributions to an $11M DOE funded next-generation particle separator system that allows for cutting edge research towards goals that include the understanding of where and how heavy elements, like gold, originate in the universe.  As a result, this and my other projects have given me chances to communicate complex results to non-technical audiences through my involvement in national conferences that includes Division of Nuclear Physics conferences as well as the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics.

In addition to my being a research assistant, I have spent the past three semesters (F19,S19,F20) as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant to three separate courses. These courses all had relatively different course structures and assumed responsibilities that furthered my skills in adaptability, communication, and empathy to successfully carry out my appointments. 

Following my love of science, technology and people, I have participated in many volunteering opportunities in order to get young people, old people, people of color, and those in between, as excited as I am about the things that science has done and continues to do! It is also my hope to provide inspiration to younger (and older) black women coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, because it my belief that everyone can be a scientist regardless of what society has told us.

Aaron Kim,1,0,5,4.9,0,1,2,0,0,0," High School Diploma; Bachelor of Science - BS;  Associate Software Engineer. . Software Developer. As a software developer at Aria Communications, I contribute to and manage the development of several of our websites. I currently work on davishousing.com and the USHousing admin site, which serve property managers in the city of Davis. 

Overall: 
• Acted as lead developer for all aspects of development for davishousing.com and the USHousing admin site.
• Built and designed websites for various clients, such as https://allypropertymanagement.net/.
• Helped revamp much needed DevOps processes at Aria Communications, such as coding guidelines, git workflow, testing guidelines, and documentation guidelines. 
• Started at the company by working with clients and internal testers to address bug fixes for Instaconnect.net: ended up refactoring thousands of lines of code, resulting in a much cleaner and manageable codebase, and implemented features like automatic email notifications, and an improved sign-up experience. 
• Mentored a junior developer in the use of our tools: .NET MVC, Razor Pages, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and related concepts: AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTTP requests, Object-Oriented Programming, and coding best practices. Highly proficient with these tools.
• Evaluated and recommended new programming tools and techniques, and selected the appropriate programming and scripting tools for tasks.. Web Development Intern. At the California Center for Cooperative Development (CCCD), I got to be a part of a team passionate about strengthening and providing support for local co-ops. As the Web Development Intern, I worked directly with many of these coops along with the Graphic Designer to provide maintenance and custom features for their websites. 

This includes the website for CCCD itself, cccd.coop, and a website I got lead for a coop that happened to be in the works while I was there, Co-op Homecare, which can be found here: coophomecare.coop. For Co-op Homecare, I made sure to select tools that would fit their business and clientele: GatsbyJS for their reputed ""Fastest Frontend for the Modern Web"" to accommodate their older-than-average clients, and a backend that pulls from WordPress, so that the non-technical staff of Co-op Homecare can update their website on their own. 
 
It was awesome to do meaningful work for clients from often come from under-served groups in society that really appreciate and can truly benefit from the exposure that comes with an online presence.. Information Technology Support Analyst. As an IT Support Analyst for the John Muir Institute of the Environment (JMIE) at UC Davis, I provided technical support for the many departments and faculty of JMIE: the faculty running the Masters of Environmental Policy and Management Program for UC Davis, the Center for Health and the environment, the research facilities found in nearby bodies of water like Lake Tahoe, etc. 

We tracked tickets through ServiceNow, and provided solutions and troubleshooting for our typically non-technical clients to hardware, software and network issues. And in our downtime, we worked on technical documentation and various side projects. 

One memorable side project was setting up and configuring an instance of Windows Server and MDT which deploys custom versions of Windows that automatically apply configurations and install licensed software, depending on the department. It was a huge improvement from manually installing those programs and setting those configurations by hand, and is still in use today.. Computer Science Tutor. Acted as a tutor for the UCD CS Tutoring Club during my Sophomore and Junior year, teaching lower-division subjects, such as ECS 10 (Basic Concepts of Computing in Python), ECS 30 (Introduction to Programming in C), ECS 40 (Software Development and Object-Oriented Programming), and ECS 60 (Data Structures, Algorithms, & Programming). 

I not only tutored students through the content of these classes, but taught them basic project management skills and programming best practices. Very important for beginner programmers. 

The club was recognized by the campus and recommended by many teachers, so we had a pretty good reputation!.

Dean Chacon, PhD has used his background in physics, mathematics, and computer programming to model complex systems (such as spacecraft imaging systems) to determine and optimize their performance, and has designed systems to meet challenging state-of-the-art requirements.

He has performed requirement decompositions to allocate requirements from systems to sub-systems and then debugged the resulting system when the sub-systems are integrated and tested, working alongside the sub-system engineers.

Specialties:
Integrating multiple sub-system technologies into a working system
Matlab, Python, C, C++, Ada, Assembler, and FORTRAN programming languages.

Modeling complex systems to estimate performance and determine the performance-driving parameters, reducing cost and risk.

Statistical methods of measuring random processes (such as imaging device pointing error) to determine the significance of the measured results, and using these methods with the Monte Carlo technique.

Location:
San Jose, CA.  Willing to relocate BSc; PhD;  Principal System Engineer. . Senior System Engineer. I worked on multiple programs, in several capabilities:

Software assurance for the Ames Research Center (ARC) in Moffett Field.  I developed software assurance plans in compliance with NASA and ARC requirements and reviewed the software development and testing for compliance with the requirements. The programs I worked on were:
  •	 TESS (SPOC). Software assurance of the data analysis pipeline as part of the GSFC administered TESS program. (2015 - 2018)
  •	 Aquila-II program through ARC, where the spacecraft sub-contractor was Millennium Space Systems (MSS). I wrote a software assurance plan while not being able to require MSS perform any work beyond their usual processes. The plan identified which MSS processes parallel NASA/ARC requirements, and fulfill the requirements. Aquila-II is a technology demonstrating geostationary satellite. (2013 - 2015)
  •	The Wetlab RNA SmartCycler program. Wrote a software assurance plan for a program that was using COTS software to control hardware to be used on the International Space Station. (2014 - 2015)
  •	Software assurance for the EDSN Nanosat program.  An extremely time and budge constrained program, that required tailoring of the software assurance effort. The EDSN Nanosat program was given a NASA Award for Excellent in the category of Group/Team. (2012 - 2014)

Also at ARC, Mission operations assurance for the K2 program; which is a follow-on to the Kepler program (2016 - 2018)

This data is usually available in the form of 'raw data'. Visualization of data using conventional excel sheet consume lot of time. This paper discuss about the project that serves as a time efficient and user friendly solution for study, analysis and representation of available earthquake data using data mining technique.. Vehicles play an eminent role in transportation. In India, vehicles have increased
days to days. This is because of population growth, easy availability of domestic cars,
and disproportionate ratio of assets. NPR is an image processing technology used to
identify vehicles by taking only number plate as a parameter. It can be used in many
applications such as entrance admission, Traffic control, security control, parking control,airport, speed control, harbor cargo control, road traffic control and so on. Every country uses their own way of designing and allocating number plates to their country vehicles.
All of them India is one of country which used number plate of vehicles own way design.
These number plates are then used by various government offices for their respective regular administrative task like- traffic police tracking those who are transgressing the traffic
rules, to identify the theft cars, in toll collection and parking allocation management etc.
The main aim of this paper is to purpose an efficient method for NPR.
Number plate recognition (NPR), as an important research field used in computer vision,
pattern recognition, image processing and artificial intelligence, is one of the most important aspects of the intelligent transportation system of human society in the 21st century.
Number Plate Recognition is comprised of three main sections: image preprocessing,
number (license) plate extraction (localization) and character recognition. NPR can be used to store the images captured by the cameras as well as the text from the license plate, with some configurable memory. NPR technology tends to be region-specific, owing to plate variation from place to place. The objective of the research is to successfully
locate vehicle number plate, segment characters and recognize them given a car image.
The system must deal with different angles, distances, scales, resolutions and illumination. Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

In this challenge, I have completed the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, I have to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Analysis and prediction of survival of passengers from the Titanic disaster. The outputs are in binary format. Three methods are used for the completion of this project. Data Analysis, Data preparation/ cleaning from the source, prediction of missing input age values using Regression and Data Modelling for final analysis. Data analysis is done using R, Data preparation and cleaning of the source data is done using SQL server data tools and SQL server management studio, The missing age values in the data file are predicted using linear regression method, Neural network model, and the final analysis is done by building a Logistic regression model and a Neural network classifier, support vector machines, supervised machine learning techniques. Testing of the model was done using the model output and the testing data provided and the prediction accuracy was in the range of 86% to 95%. To implement the K-Means algorithm using MapReduce to make it scalable. The inputs of the algorithm were the data file and the centroid file. The data file contains m data points. Each data
point is represented as an n-dimensional numeric vector. The centroid file has K

Image recognition and classification is a rapidly growing field in the area of machine learning. In particular, object recognition is a key feature of image classification, and the commercial implications of this are vast. Image classifiers will increasingly be used to: Replace passwords with facial recognition, Allow autonomous vehicles to detect obstructions, Identify geographical features from satellite imagery.. Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable.

Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications, or conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sickle cell disease, asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough (such as following a stroke), and a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays, blood tests, and the culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.

In this project, I have a dataset that has labeled images for Pneumonia and Normal X-Rays.
I have used CNN to train the algorithm which then successfully identifies the Pneumonia in an X-Ray with 90% accuracy..

The purpose of this project is to integrate our knowledge of logic circuits into a real-world application using a robot, named the Krysis Robot, and a track to follow. A logic circuit is made to control the motors in a robot. The robot is a simple creation made from a base, motor with wheels, and some components to power and control the motors. Inductors are used in the robot to sense the magnetic field of wire in the track. The objective is to make sure the robot is able to run through the whole track.. *note: For this project, I was in charge of creating the system and coding the Arduino to run the data. 

For our final project, we decided to construct a vertical suspension system. We built a fully functional suspension system without dampers and a Simulink simulation of this same dynamic system. We were able to collect data from both the physical and simulated systems. 
We recorded the velocity and position over time for both systems and were able to compare the graphs respectively to see how the two systems performed in a similar manner.

The FGC-9 is a Hybrid 3D printed firearm meaning its main construction is made of 3D printed plastic while the pressure barring parts is made of metal. The firearm is classified as a pistol caliber carbine, shooting 9mm semi-auto, capable of accepting Glock magazines. 
This project uses completely off-the-shelf parts which makes this project completely DIY and no previous experience necessary.  I created a homemade barrel using ECM rifling, which is a technique using electrodes to shave off the material of the barrel to the desired shape. The bolt of the firearm is also homemade by welding together 2 18mm steel rods of different lengths.
Overall, this project heavily applied different aspects of engineering and gave me the experience of 3D printing, machining, electro-machining, welding, and of course, firearms..

Much of this burden has been attributed to the epidemiologic transition occurring in India, with urbanization and increasing obesity. However, high rates of hypertension occur even in populations with lower rates of traditional risk factors and in rural areas. Therefore, there is a need to determine risk factors specific to low-income populations. Hence, the use of data mining algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forrest model without
tuning parameter but with the standard number of trees. Boosted tree model with tuning (adjusting learning rates and trees), Stochastic gradient boosting(auto-adjusted tuning parameter),
Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayes ) could be useful in predicting Hypertension. Therefore this research aims to predict whether a person has a higher prevalence of hypertension or not based on their Sociodemographic information, Healthcare access, Precious hypertension history, Food security, and Nutrition, Mental health (using Kessler 6 score), Physical Activity (METS score), Substance abuse (Tobacco, alcohol, others), Measurements (weight, height, waist, BP, BMI), Illness, BSDS, Medicine Adherence score (forgetfulness, frequency of meds), Women’s healthcare access, Preparedness (awareness program)..

Developed an application to plan trips in Chicago using the GPS coordinates, attempting to replicate the functionality of Google maps. The main rule of this event is to build your project within 24 hours, my team and I built our 'Dogbot' which is a robot that tracks the objects standing in front of it, and stops when it gets really close to them.. In this project, we worked with a community partner called C3 (The Chicago Conservation Corps) which supports adult volunteers (“Leaders”) who lead community‐based environmental service projects. The community partner asked us to do three different sub-projects. The one I worked on was finding an inventory solution for their stock within a total cost of no more than $200. After researching, analyzing, and synthesizing almost all the possible solutions, we came up with three proposals that fit their criteria. Eventually, they picked up one of them, so we offered them a complete analysis and test of that one, in addition to a step-by-step tutorial.. HASP flight program is supported by the NASA Balloon Program Office (BPO) and Louisiana Space Consortium (LaSPACE). 
http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code820/index.html

It's a balloon which carries up to twelve student payloads to an altitude of about 36 kilometers with a flight duration of 15 to 20 hours using a small volume, zero pressure balloon. Twelve prestigious universities around the U.S are participating in this project including IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology) which I am part of its team. 

Our team is to use three cameras to send live pictures to the ground control station during the flight, which needs using GPS device to synchronize everything. Also the team is studying the environment conditions like pressure, wind, humidity, and atmosphere in order to make sure that all the electronic devices will work well. 

My current task is to analyze the radio link between the transmission system and the ground control station, including the bit error rate (BER), signal to noise ration (SNR), and link budget.. Designed an iOS app for monitoring hypertensive patients during MHacks Fall 2013.. VoiceHack is an Android phone app that transcribes voice commands, which are sent to an Amazon AWS server, understood by Raspberry Pi, which would then command physical things (i.e. lights and doors) in a house, or any other different physical application. TADHack Hackathon is an international hackathon focuses on applications that uses VoIP APIs. In 2014 competition, we created a web application called ""Holla Home"" where ""Holla"" is Spanish for ""Hi"". The web application has a phone number reserved to it which the user can call. When user calls the phone number, he/she can give voice commands to conrol electrical switches at home. We implemented a voice API created by Nexmo to provide voice recognition functionality. Commands are sent to a web server (coded in PHP) which processes them then send commands over the internet to a Raspberry Pi that is connected to home circuit switches. The Raspberry Pi has a Python script which translates commands into electrical signals to turn switches on/off. The application had a confirmation system to acknowledge that task was completed.

• Used creative approaches like design thinking to understand needs of women in low-income communities. Designed solutions to improve lives at scale. 
• Created a cooperative for local village women to sell homemade soap. 
• Worked in a FabLab utilizing 3D printing and automation tools to make process improvements for soap- making thereby reducing cycle time for maximizing output.  KATHA was an initiative taken by our group which consisted of 10 MIT students (Massachusetts Institute of technology) and 10 students from all parts of India. There was a group of women in the village of chirayinkeezhu who made soap for a living and 
sold the soaps for a very cheap rate and never made much profit. We changed the soap design, the mould shapes and the packaging to give a much expensive appearance. We have also found a market for them and worked on the business plan.. The effects of machining parameters, Cutting Speed, Feed Rate, and Depth of cut, on surface finish during peripheral milling of AISI 4340 steel, is studied in this paper using the response surface methodology (RSM). This paper suggests a distinctive way to calculate the surface finish in milling, using the effective plastic strain (PEEQ) values obtained from the numerical model. Finite element model was developed to accurately predict the surface finish by correlating the variance of the PEEQ. The Johnson-Cook damage model is used to describe the material damage criteria. The material constitutive behavior is described by Johnson-Cook material model. In order to accurately predict the material flow, while machining, a dynamic explicit method is used along with the Adaptive Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. The optimization of machining parameters was studied by assuming Central Composite Design (CCD). The output response, PEEQ, was fitted into analytical quadratic polynomial models using ANOVA, which shows that cutting speed was the most dominant factor for PEEQ than the other parameters considered in this study. The optimal settings of the machining parameters was obtained, using the individual desirability function method, for better surface finish..

My project work has focused on improving the security of the Android system. I have developed a system to protect mobile applications from malicious advertisements by isolating untrusted ad’s privilege and display from an Android app. To allow a user to securely enter a text input (e.g. password) or securely approve an action (e.g. confirming a bank transfer), I have developed a system that protects the user interaction channel of touch input for Android applications using ARM TrustZone. In addition, to allow a user to make a secure VoIP call from a compromised Android device, I have developed a system to protect the user interaction channel of voice I/O for VoIP calls using ARM TrustZone. I have co-authored multiple papers in the process, with one paper published in a top-tier system conference. In addition to exploring security from the perspective of system research, I have also worked as a research assistant to develop security education labs (SEED labs) which are now being used at several universities around the world.

Hardware Setup: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jaEmklk6vQE7X15SiRC2XDL564JSl-il/view?usp=sharing

Video demo: The Hikey board has no camera hardware attached to it. The camera is attached to the Raspberry Pi. The screen shows the app running on Android (on the Hikey board). The demo shows a proof-of-concept where the app requests TEE for camera data, which obtains it from the Raspberry Pi board. In the video, the recording camera is put down at time 0:30 for 4 seconds, in order to press the button in the app to request camera capture.

Aaron Magaziner,1,0,6,5.65,0,1,2,6,6,0," Exchange; Bachelor's degree;  Robotics Engineer. (C++)  Advanced Multi-Agent Cooperative Ecosystem (MACE), a C++ stack designed for the operation and cooperation of autonomous vehicle systems, in order to conduct live and simulated flight tests of a machine-learned aircraft control system and analyze ways to bridge the gap from simulation to reality.

(C++) Integrated SLAM and CNN image processing tools into a ROS architecture to enable a quadcopter to autonomously traverse and map notable objects in a GPS-denied environment for the NSWC AISUM challenge

(Python) Designed and oversaw training of machine-learned aircraft control system that successfully commanded a Talon XUAV aircraft to static or dynamic waypoints or altitude/heading targets 

(Python, C++)  Developed a complete data logging and analysis architecture in order to rapidly produce  relevant analytics and plots for a large number of flight tests

(Python)  Designed expert system behaviors to manage aiming, navigation, and collision avoidance for a hybrid AI dogfighting agent for a simulated F16 fighter

(React.js)  Created an interactive MACE GUI for remote initiation, control, and monitoring of flight operations. Undergraduate Teaching Fellow. Graded quizzes/exams and held office hours for the introductory physics course, PHYS161, for STEM students at the University of Maryland.. Project Engineering Intern. Assisted Project Engineers with quality control, material procurement, requests for information, submittals, BIM Models, and other tasks relating to the installation of steel, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems at a new Walt Disney World attraction.. Undergradate Teaching Fellow. Graded quizzes/exams and held office hours for the introductory physics course, PHYS161, for STEM students at the University of Maryland.. Ride Operator. I spent a summer as a ride operator at Hersheypark, a regional amusement park. I worked on rides spanning from tiny merry-go-rounds to large roller coasters, sometimes alone, and sometimes in teams of up to 8 people. Over the three months, I gained a great deal of experience with teamwork, multitasking, and customer service.. Part-time Science Educator. Ran temporary demos in a family museum displaying many different aspects of science such as physics, anatomy, astronomy, and paleontology. In addition to educating myself about various scientific topics (particularly those related to physics and astronomy). I gained more experience with hospitality and customer service..  Developed and tested a high altitude balloon payload designed to compare methods of 
measuring vertical velocity during the balloon’s flight using an array of pitot tubes and GPS.. Led a 9-person team to create an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating unknown terrain in order to locate and extinguish multiple fire sites before communicating mission success or failure. I wrote navigation and mission code (Arduino), modeled parts for 3D printing, assembled/soldered electronics, selected materials, and conducted testing to solve a large variety of hardware and software issues.
Ultimately, the vehicle won 1st place in the competition against 12 teams.. Designed a digital model to conduct research on potential outcomes of an autonomous “scout” train to extend the vision of large trains with long braking distances. The simulation explored scout effectiveness with random obstacles and varying velocities.. Designed and tested a 3D-printed dart, called a waverider, in a hypersonic wind tunnel (approx. Mach 6) with the goal of minimizing mass and maximizing Lift/Drag ratio. 

I was in charge of using MATLAB's image processing toolbox to write a program to collect position data from the test video footage. This data could then be used to determine the real performance of the waverider in the wind tunnel.. Programmed a small autonomous robot (using Python) in order to complete a variety of challenges. 

Notably, one of the challenges was to navigate a maze that had dots of various colors on the walls which guided the vehicle. The system had to use image processing and ultrasonic sensors to read the visual instructions and make the proper motions in order to escape the maze.

An additional challenge began by randomly placing the robot into a box of known dimensions. The bot was tasked with autonomously navigating to the center of the box in the least possible time. I noted that by rotating until the ultrasonic sensors picked up a corner and a nearby wall (perpendicular to the vehicle), the starting position could be quickly triangulated. Then, it could calculate the trajectory to the center and instantly roll to it.. Designing and testing a controller for active aerodynamic surfaces on a race car designed for competition against other schools. The system will add cornering and braking capability while reducing drag on straightaways..

Research Volunteer Intern. 1) Researched basic principles of Cyber Forensics and experimented with Paraben P2c Commander and Device Seizure Toolkit and Autopsy (Sleuth Toolkit).
2) Scanned the contents of USB disks for hidden sectors and tried to predict the data it contained previously
3) Implemented Ciphers like Vigenere Cipher, Diffie Hellman, RSA cipher.  eNotice Board is a Responsive web based application using Bootstrap & AngularJS
JavaScript Front-End Frameworks and PHP as backhand, through which application user can create an online notice board, add notices and update the noticeboard. Other users can pin to that particular noticeboard and get notification regarding updates. User can also share the noticeboard with other interested member. Our project is divided into four modules as a complete solution for perfect cab management viz. Automatic Cab Allocation Server in C#.NET, Cab Tracking Server in C#.NET, an Android application for driver and Responsive cross-platform web application for customer using Front end frameworks like Bootstrap and AngularJS and a backhand server using PHP. MS SQL Server facilitates data which is communicated among all the modules. Integrating all the modules and developing an automatic cab allocation algorithm was the most challenging aspect of the project.. Developed a port scanning application in Python using ScaPy Library, which scans the ports that are open in the target host, determining which application are running on which port, by sending TCP and UDP packets. Developed a responsive web application as a part of project component of coursework in the subject Database systems. Users are able to create a project, periodically update project progress; can sponsor funds to a project. Sponsors are notified regarding updates. Application is also having social networking facilities like comment on a project, like on a project and follow a user. Project sponsor can also rate the project at the end of the project completion. Also the database design includes required triggers and  an event which runs periodically to update the contents of database. Event calls a procedure over an interval which has nested cursor implemented for updating the required fields of the database.. Developed a Tweet Map application using AWS Cloud technologies. Firstly deployed the first release of the project by creating a Django Web application, which collects tweets from Twitter Sentiment Analysis API and indexes them over Elastic search. Frontend sends AJAX requests to Django app, which fetches the tweets from ES and indexes them simultaneously.

2) As an extension to above, I migrated my entire Server side code to AWS serverless. Created 4 Lambda functions which take requests, fetches tweets, performs sentiment analysis using IBM Watson NLP API and finally indexes tweets to Elastic Search. SQS  is used as tweet queue and SNS is used for invoking other Lambda functions for coordination. Front-end sends AJAX requests periodically to ES and fetches the indexed tweets for the user intended keyword. 

3) Instead of using SQS, trying to setup Kafka server on EC2 instance.. Collected Youtube videos data from Youtube API using python program which populates the cleaned JSON youtube video object into Kafka topic. MemSQL database pipeline listens on the Kafka topic and indexes the new data into MemSQL DB. Using Spark, top videos in each category is processed based on video metrics, hot words in that category are calculated using Map reduce tasks, one for each category.  Visualization for resultant data of spark program is visualized using Tableau. I am volunteering on the research project as a part of Secure Systems Lab at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

• Performed content-based filtering on the graph generated by executing the cypher commands from the script generated using R code to recommend a list of courses that match the skill set, previous student ratings and the instructor of the course provided as input, and assigned weights to the resulting list obtained for each attribute to generate a weighted algorithm that displays the suggestions in form of a Neo4j graph.. ● Developed a publish-subscribe communication model similar to Apache Kafka for distributed systems for collecting and distributing real-time data generated from multiple sources using data structures such as message queues in Google’s golang.
● Distributed the incoming message requests to the producers among different partitions by using round-robin load balancing algorithm to schedule request for processing to a particular partition inside the producer servers.
● Handled fault-tolerance issues occurring due to failure of master-node managing the distributed cluster by implementing Raft Consensus algorithm in golang that appoints one of the available nodes as leader node to manages and directs commands to execute to other follower nodes.
● Implemented a local file storage mechanism using the Reader, Writer and Scanner classes of the bufio package in golang, by creating intermediate files to store the log messages exchanged between publishers and subscribers across the network. 
● Enabled communication between leader and data nodes for distribution of log messages across the cluster by sending heartbeat messages via RPC client library in golang to ensure the availability of nodes for processing.
● Ensured the synchronized access to intermediate log files generated during processing as well as preserved the state of application at a particular instance of time by implementing locking protocols and state machine replication using sync.mutex library in golang.. ● Hadoop: Processed a large text file of around 200MB across Hadoop cluster leveraging HDFS and MapReduce for distributed storage and processing by successfully replicating the file across multiple data nodes in the cluster using Hadoop commands such as copyFromLocal, fsck, and setup to name a few to handle scalability and fault-tolerance of data stored in file. Performed batch processing of the file by counting words appearing four times or more using MapReduce by dividing the words into buckets with key value pairs containing word as the key and frequency count as the value in a bucket.

● Text Analytics: Performed Text Analytics/Text Mining to extract meaningful information from unstructured data using the following methods:
• Semantic Analytics on the State of Union Address speeches given by Presidents of the United States from 1989-2017 by finding the frequency of words with strong positive/negative sentiments to predict whether given speech has a positive/negative polarity.
• Preparing a Corpus – a collection of documents for text analysis - for the speech data by removing the punctuations, special characters and stop words using the tm package in R. Converted the Corpus into a set of individual tokens for each word occurring in the corpus using the Term Document Matrix in the tm package of R, to find the difference between frequency of words with positive and negative sentiments. Modelled the difference as a sentiment and used it to plot the value against different Presidents as labels in a boxplot using the ggplot library of R..

Developed to enhance the resiliency of network storage solutions against ransomware events and network intrusion. Extras: self-made intrusion detection alarms using random inode monitoring, python-automated share configuration utility.. Detecting suspicious activity through inode monitoring with inotify-tools. Watches hidden directories filled with honeypot text files at the top of a volume. When ransomware recursively attacks a volume, this hidden folder will be attacked first. When a set threshold of files gets modified or deleted (as notified by inotify),  an alert is sent out. If the monitored volume is a network storage location, the alert will include instructions to terminate the suspected compromised connection.. I came into a new role as a DevOps Engineer at SmartBear, working on an application with some pretty unique infrastructure challenges. In addition to a fairly standard AWS technology stack, my team had to manage a fleet of about 300 additional servers located in around 30 different countries around the world hosted in all manner of ways--colocations, dedicated server providers, VPS services, and larger cloud providers. This situation disallowed the ""cattle, not pets"" philosophy that is promoted in modern DevOps and SRE.

Idempotent infrastructure for these 300-ish servers was not possible since we had no direct control over system images or ad-hoc infrastructure deployments. Given the restriction imposed by the underlying infrastructure, Ansible was the primary tool used to align systems with as much identicality as we could manage. To that end, Ansible dynamic inventory provided a very powerful way to centrally configure Ansible-managed hosts.

Fortunately for us, our application already relied on a MySQL server inventory table that we could leverage for Ansible inventory. A host_type field mapped directly to Ansible host groups, and a delimited string of feature flags could be passed as an array hostvar enabling conditional execution of tasks. With these already in-hand, all that was needed was a script to format each host row into Ansible inventory-compatible JSON.. Much of modern operations is based around automation. Monitoring and observability are all very important, but if a person has to react and intervene on monitoring alerts then that person becomes a bottleneck. Eventually it was realized that if procedures and remediations could be defined for operators in runbooks, then there's no reason that runbook couldn't be executed automatically--this gave birth to tools like Rundeck.

We use many different monitoring tools internally. One of these tools is Zabbix, a MySQL-based system monitoring suite. We like Zabbix for its flexibility--absolutely any arbitrary data that you can generate at a shell prompt can be regularly collected and monitored by Zabbix without the same kind of cardinality issues that would affect most time-series based monitoring tools. An extension of this capability is Zabbix Actions; the same way arbitrary shell commands can be executed on remote hosts to collect data, arbitrary shell commands can be executed when trigger conditions are met. Assume a trigger that fires when a process $p dies, an Action can simply start $p.

There was one problem to overcome with this: preventing Zabbix from interfering with an operator. If for whatever reason an operator was intentionally making changes that could trigger alerts, we didn't want Zabbix to then be simultaneously firing off commands, causing confusion and inconsistency. So a crucial requirement was to implement some form of idle session detection--if users were logged in and not idle, then Zabbix should never execute actions on that machine. If there were no sessions or idle sessions, then Zabbix could go ahead and take its remediation steps. We parse the w command for idle times, which counts time since the user's last keystroke.. Our team was looking for a way to aggregate and report on certain API usage metrics which we could only retrieve from Docker-based HTTP logs. I had previously implemented Docker log aggregation with Filebeat and Elastic Cloud. One of the features of Elasticsearch is the ingest pipeline where you can define parsing and mutation rules for inputs prior to indexing. Many people use Logstash as part of the ""ELK stack"" for this purpose, but it's less commonly known that parsing and mutation can also be done on Elasticsearch itself, making use of existing compute and reducing complexity in the logging stack.

I took the existing NGINX log ingest pipeline (provided by Filebeat) and extended it to grok out the query string pattern from the request URL. Once I had the query string separated, it could be split on the & character and each key-value pair could be loaded into the index using the kv processor. This made possible aggregation queries to the effect of `select count(requests) where url.fields.time_range is not NULL group by url.fields.time_range`. The resulting data from this example would be very valuable for determining platform improvements, like optimizing web server cache time and InfluxDB shard group durations.. Time-series data is at the heart of the application I support. Our teams' primary customer-facing product is (for the most part) a series of dashboards and reports displaying metric data backended by InfluxDB. One day one of our QA engineers was expressing that it would be easier to compare the functionality of charts and graphs across different code versions if they were always rendering the same data, regardless of when the comparison was being done.

I took it upon myself to write a tool that could output a consistent metric set to an InflxuDB instance for any arbitrary window of time. Using this tool, the QA team could eliminate variability in data and perform more consistent testing. Eventually I would like to extend this tool to output data for other commonly used time-series databases, like Prometheus and Graphite.. If you simply google the title above, you'll see very many people asking how to accomplish this task. The demand is so great that it's honestly amazing that Docker have not extended the docker logs command to support multiple containers. Even docker-compose logs will output a stream of logs from all containers defined in the compose file! It seems to be an obvious use-case to everyone but Docker themselves. So to right this wrong I created a tool for myself that streams multiple container logs directly from the Docker API. I placed a hard limit of eight simultaneous streams in case this much concurrency could be a problem for the API, though I've done no testing or research to see if this is even the case.. Our team has long-used docker-compose to manage container workloads, writing compose files in the compose v2 format. I was tasked with migrating us to Docker Swarm Mode which exclusively uses compose v3. I was immediately concerned with the implications of maintaining two separate compose files per environment and the potential that creates for configuration drift, so instead I chose to develop a tool to translate a given compose file in the v2 format to v3. This way, we would continue to use the same v2 files we always had, and the deploy pipeline would automatically convert the file to the required format at deploy time.

Initially I thought this would be a straightforward case of renaming certain yaml keys, or trimming unneeded deprecated configurations. As I began though, I realized that our organization made heavy use of the depends_on and extends features of compose v2 that had been deprecated with no equivalent or replacement as of version 3.8. The challenge then became to find a way to replicate the behaviors v2 offered during translation.. Many aeons ago, my organization managed an internal git server for all our team's source code. Eventually a decision was made to migrate to GitHub, starting first with new repositories and then later transferring existing ones. All went well until they got to the last and most critical of all the repositories--a 20+ year old behemoth that itself started life as a migrated Subversion repository. Over the decades, users had made the poor decision to check in large binaries. These binaries were eventually removed, but once they're in git history the binary content is checked in forever, taking up space. GitHub imposes a limit on repo import of a maximum 3 GB repo size and 100 MB maximum checked-in file size--our repo exceeded both.

I presented two potential solutions--adopt Git LFS, performing a migration of binary files in history to LFS using git-lfs-migrate, or simply strip all large files from history using BFG Repo Cleaner. Migrating to LFS would preserve git history but incur a storage cost on GitHub, whereas using BFG Repo Cleaner would alter historical commit IDs as all commit hashes would have to be recalculated after the content was removed from history. We decided that, given our relatively small team, altering history was not a deal-beaker and we could simply all re-clone after the repository was cleaned up. In the end, BFG Repo Cleaner shrunk the repository to around 450 MB, a nearly 90% decrease in footprint.. Our development team grew to a point where our existing handful of Docker dev and QA environments became a bottleneck and started causing contention over feature deployments. In the past with a smaller team, it was uncommon for two or more developers to be simultaneously but separately working on the same microservices. To deal with this, I was tasked with finding a way to grant developers on-demand, dynamic, individual environments within the development Swarm cluster. Accomplishing this required every tool in our team's arsenal; Terraform, Python, Groovy, MySQL, Ansible, shell scripts, Makefiles, InfluxDB, and Jenkins came together like Voltron to build a system that could:

* Provision and assign individualized AWS infrastructure
* Tag all resources for cost analysis per-environment and per-user
* Isolate Docker image builds to avoid poisoning each other's build caches
* Support any size deployment, from individual microservices to full stack
* Dynamically modify container environments as neighbor services are spun up or down
* Alert on deployment inactivity to ensure against abandoned environments

The centerpieces that made this system possible are the Terraform external datasource which enabled infrastructure configurations to be fetched and generated from a centralized MySQL environment metadata table, the Ansible docker_swarm and docker_node modules with which EC2 instances could be dynamically added to and removed from the Swarm, and the Jenkins Extended Choice Parameter plugin with which complex forms could be presented to users for fine-grained control over environment configuration..

Aakarsh Tandon,1,0,6,7.49,4,1,2,5,21,0,"A Mechanical Engineer with a penchant for problem-solving. I've been an integral member of the Engineering team at Van Doren Sales over the last three years where I've worked on several challenging projects in the Material Handling industry. I've led projects from concept through prototyping and into production and have learned immensely along the way. 
Throughout my formative years, I had a fascination with automobiles and moving parts which drove me to pursue a career in Mechanical Design. Having a passion for everything on wheels - engineering, design, performance, it was a massive learning experience being a member of the Formula SAE team at UIC where I worked as part of the Aerodynamics and Composites subsystem teams and was involved from concept through all aspects of design to validation of various components.
Social causes spur me on and the devastating wildfires of 2017 in the state of California provided our team of diverse engineers a pertinent subject for a mini-research project. We created supervised machine learning models and employed predictive analysis to identify the leading causes of wildfires over the last 30 years.

An efficient, dedicated, and resourceful engineer always looking to deliver my best. My key strengths include effective communication and analytical skills, and the ability to get things done.
A firm believer that learning is a continual process and success comes to those who work for it.

I enjoy the outdoors and most weekends you'll find me exploring the highs of a mountain or the depths of a lake. I'm also big into a variety of sports ranging from football to soccer.

Aanand Sharma,1,0,12,8.34,0,1,3,0,9,0,"Mathematician turned entrepreneur turned data scientist turned chiropractor. I don't get it, either. High School; Bachelor of Arts (BA); Doctor of Chiropractic;  Data Scientist. Promoted to Data Scientist in Business Analytic Services, I moved to New York City to pursue a solutions-oriented consulting role. There, I participated in client interviews, RFP briefings, and subsequent proposal meetings and pitches.

My role during these interviews was to understand the client's current data sources and quality in order to determine how to derive necessary data-driven insights. Using this information, I would participate in team discussions to come up with a holistic tech solution. Though I didn't implement these solutions, the role requires a deep understanding of data science and statistical modeling to recognize meaningful opportunities. 

Generally, these are consumer-products clients looking to improve communications with customers, but the opportunities vary daily. Since the clients can vary so drastically, each solution is custom to the business problem, requiring extensive research and understanding of many industries.. Senior Software Development Engineer. Promoted to Senior Developer, I was deployed onto a project at The Boeing Company. Here, I created a custom tool to aid engineers in creating flight tests to satisfy certification requirements. At a high level, this tool would help engineers discover which requirements were compatible and could be satisfied on the same flight, reducing the amount of flights necessary.

Creating this tool required cleaning and understanding unstructured data, interviewing engineers to understand business-specific rules, and incorporating various mathematical tools like set theory and linear algebra.

Significantly, when I was brought onto this project, there wasn't a clear solution. After working on the project for a few weeks, I was able to recognize the problem as an Set Theory problem, and subsequently solved the problem within just a few months.

This project was very successful, leading in up to 15% cost reductions for flight testing.. Software Development Engineer. As a Software Development Engineer at HCL Technologies, I worked in a data science and machine learning R&D group. I primarily worked with Python and Microsoft Azure ML. These projects were generally predictive models using public data sets, utilizing clustering, classification, and regression models.. Consultative Sales Associate. Worked in consultative commissioned sales at Nordstrom, providing the highest level of customer service. Made personal connections with customers and built my own clientele. Researched product origins and company brands, offering depth and breadth of product information to inquiring customers.. Co-Owner and Business Director. After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked on developing a small-group/personal training business in my community. While my business partner took care of daily operations at the fitness center, I worked to generate sales leads via a marketing mix (including social media, paid advertisements, etc) and to make strategic decisions regarding growth (such as hiring full time employees, starting an internship program, and contracting additional trainers to lead group classes like yoga).

Together, we were able to grow the business to over 45 clients and made a significant impact on the community. I stepped down from my role as I moved out of state for work, but the business continues to prosper.. Procurement Financial Analyst Intern - Commercial Aviation Services. As an intern in the Commercial Aviation Services business within Boeing, I worked in a PFA role to work on the procurement of spare parts. Here, my major projects were in the financial analysis of high-valued (multimillion dollar valued) documentation. Additionally, I was given the task of creating and conducting a presentation of the analysis for senior level management, giving me the opportunity to have face-time with higher level employees.

While here, I decided to take on my own projects to improve efficiency on recurring projects. I created a standardized template to conduct the financial analysis on HVDs, which ended up cutting a few hours from the analysis process. In addition, I was able to meet with interns in other roles to learn more about the other aspects within the CAS business.

Overall, the most important things that I took from the internship were 1) a more in-depth knowledge of the aerospace industry, 2) extensive experience working in Microsoft Excel, and 3) better understanding of how a large business operates. My experience at Boeing was overall positive, and I am very appreciative of this opportunity.. Rotational HQ Intern. Through my network, I was able to work as a summer intern at International News, a company that designs and produces fashion lines, including A. Tiziano and The Zebra Club. Within International News, I was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to work in every department within this company, including the Finance and Accounting, Inventory and Operations, and Design departments. Within each department, I:

-Organized and entered invoices into AccPac Pro Series Software,
-Consolidated credit reports with corresponding statements and invoices,
-Read and edited legal documents,
-Conducted inventory control procedures,
-Analyzed new marketing strategies for current inventory, and
-Created strategies to efficiently plan business expenses. Resident Assistant and Senior Resident. A Resident Assistant, or RA, works with Residence Life and the Dean of Students to provide support to students in many ways. This can range from general questions regarding campus life to emotional counseling and support. I had the opportunity to work in Residence Life for two years, first as an RA, and then as a Senior Resident (SR). 

During my first year, I worked (and lived) in the Multi-Ethnic Center for Cultural Awareness (the MECCA) where I led a small group of students who created and implemented programs for the rest of our campus. In the past, we were able to learn Pysanky (Ukrainian Easter Egg decorations), host Tibetan monks for a Sand Mandala exposition, and celebrate Holi (the Indian festival of Colors). As the RA, I was in charge of overseeing all projects, helping students take initiative, as well as planing and budgeting for each event.

During my second year, I worked in Anderson Hall, a first-year residence hall, where I was the RA of A-Section and the SR of the building. As the SR, I have additional responsibility and work more closely with the Resident Director. I help support the other five RAs in the building, and meet 1-on-1 with each RA biweekly to reflect on occurrences and programming efforts in each section. Finally, I am also in charge of scheduling for all seven staff members. 

Being an RA was a life changing experience for me. It allowed me to learn how to organize my time efficiently as we have weekly 3 hour meetings and on-going deadlines. It taught me a lot about myself and my learning styles, as well as how to use my strengths and weaknesses to become a more effective leader. Finally, it taught me how to deal with extremely stressful situations in a calm manner.. Intern of Office of Religious and Spiritual Life. As an Intern of Religious Life, I acted as a student representative of religious diversity at Whitman College. With the support of three other interns, I planed, advertised, and implemented various programs relating to different faith groups that were represented on campus, including bringing speakers to campus, organizing religious festivals, and much more.. Academic Resource Center Tutor. At the Academic Resource Center (ARC), students are able to reach out and receive personal help for any course offered on campus. Tutors who work for the ARC are trained to use different methods of teaching (using VARK methods, etc) to allow students to succeed in classrooms. As one of my majors is in Math, I have had the opportunity to be one of few student tutors who provides students with help in Mathematics courses such as Calculus 1 - 3.. Consultative Sales Associate. At Sears, I worked as a consultative sales associate in the Consumer Electronics department. Here, I learned about our products (televisions, sound systems, video games and consoles, laptop computers, etc). Out of my sales team, I was one of the best performing salesmen in terms of products sold and add-on sales. Having seen how much attention I pay to detail, I was given additional tasks by my supervisors and leaders. For example, I was asked to help prepare schedules for the other salespeople, and was even asked to help prepare the floor plan for the product flow for the next cycle.. Teacher's Assistant. At Kumon, I helped students succeed in classes by providing them support in Mathematics and English. The ""Kumon Method"" involves a process where students progress at their own pace, while the teacher creates an individualized program for each student. The program is based off of packets of worksheets, ranging from basic addition to algebra to advanced levels of calculus, as well as basic letter recognition to literature analysis. 

My main responsibilities included preparing students' programs and then providing them help throughout the way. Since I had an understanding for mathematics, I was in charge of helping students who were in the more advanced sections of the program. Also, on the other side of the spectrum, I was responsible for helping students from the age of 3-6 learn to read proficiently, learning patience and an appreciation for education..

Worked on a project, “Statistical Analysis of Avocado Data for Predicting Average Price” for my Business Analytics with R course. The project involved analyzing avocado sales data taken from Hass Avocado Board. The data ranged from Jan 2015 to May 2020. We tested for the following hypotheses 
1.	Avocado Pricing shows more relationship to season rather than region. (This hypothesis was not     rejected)
2.	Over time, across all regions, consumers become less price sensitive. (This hypothesis was rejected)
3.	There is a change in avocado prices during the seasonal California wildfires. (This hypothesis was not rejected)
We used several algorithms for predictive modeling like linear regression, subset selection, regularized regression, and ensemble methods. We found that Random Forest was the best model based on lowest RMSE of 0.1327. This model displayed that the type, avocado size, and bag sizes seem to be the most influential variables in determining average price. Businesses can use this model to further understand the avocado pricing structure to make sound business decisions and enhance their business.. In this report, sentiment and time series analysis has been used to answer three important questions regarding Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine:
1. Is willingness to be vaccinated increasing or decreasing?
2. What are some of the reasons for public hesitancy about getting vaccinated?
3. What motivates people most to get vaccinated?
To help answer these questions , the following hypotheses have been analyzed:
1. The dominant sentiment about the vaccine is Positive.
2. The daily average sentiment follows an upward trend.
3. The sentiment series is stationary and can be used to forecast average sentiment score in the future.
4. There is a strong correlation between the average sentiment score and the percentage of people vaccinated.
5. There is a strong correlation between the average sentiment score and daily number of tweets.
From the analysis, we can conclude that, people are generally accepting towards Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and are willing to get vaccinated. People having negative attitude towards the vaccine are more concerned about the side effects, it’s safety and allergies. People showcasing positive sentiment seem to believe in scientific studies carried out to develop the vaccine, approvals given and efficacy of the vaccine against COVID-19. This analysis would help public health authorities design and plan vaccine campaigns to increase public inoculation by focusing their ads and campaigns on concerns that people have..

The purpose of this research is to investigate the emotional antecedents of the phenomenon of competitive victimhood. Competitive Victimhood (CV), a relatively new concept in the field of experimental Social Psychology, occurs when members of conflicting groups try to establish that their group has suffered more than their adversarial group. In this research program we are interested in examining the emotions that may precede CV. Although there has been a fair amount of research into CV and possible ways to reduce it, to our knowledge, there has been no research done yet isolating its specific emotional antecedents.If we understand CV to be a way of dealing with a threat to the moral image of one’s in-group while involved in an intergroup conflict, then we could predict two distinct pathways to CV. Our study will only focus on the first pathway: concern over the group’s image (image pathway) would suggest that the emotional antecedents to CV might be anxiety (that the group will be impugned) or guilt and/or shame. The second pathway, perceived suffering within a hostile intergroup context (suffering pathway), would suggest that the emotional antecedents to CV might be anger at the adversarial group for harms incurred or pride in the in-group’s ability to endure suffering. But, as it would be difficult to argue that the intergroup relationship between men and women could be described as hostile our study will not look into these emotions..

The act of play—especially constructive play with puzzles has been shown to lay a foundation for learning math concepts. In our study, 4 - 7 year olds play two different games involving manipulating shapes to help researchers understand more about spatial learning and creativity. Our main dependent measure was whether or not they utilized the tangram shapes in their play; failure to use the tangram shapes is taken as evidence for functional fixedness (a cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used).. ""Introversion, Extroversion, and the Impact of Social Interaction on the 'Cognitive Battery'""

This research investigates and compares the cognitive threshold for exhaustion due to social interaction in both introverts and extroverts. We analyzed contributing factors to cognitive exhaustion in introverts through the investigation of differences [from extroverts] in factors such as socials skill, unease/distrust around others, energy output, and social. Overall, we were able to detect minor trends in data to indicate that there may be some differences in performance between introverts and extroverts on the cognitive exhaustion task. We can see only some inclinations of introverts towards exhaustion after social interaction, a slight trend in overall exhaustion in introverts, and little evidence of cognitive exhaustion a response to social interaction.. This  work seeks to explore how moral judgments of racial passing are shaped by two ideological factors: social dominance orientation (SDO) and endorsement of colorblind ideology. When a person engages in racial passing (presents themselves as a race other than their own) they threaten both the hierarchical status quo--thereby upsetting people high in SDO who prefer strict social hierarchies--and drawing attention to race and racial inequality--thereby upsetting people high in colorblindness who believe society should ignore race. Subsequent experiments will both measure and manipulate these ideological factors, which are expected to shape the moral judgments of racial passers and their behavior. As such, this work provides a new framework for understanding the role of moral judgments in person perception, an incredibly important but historically understudied topic recently targeted for expansion in social cognition research.. “Modern Media’s Documentation of Shifting Cultural Attitudes on ‘Racial Passing’ in the USA”

Over the last 60 years, perceptions and attitudes towards race have been quickly changing in the United States. In news today, stories of “racial passing” – when a person classified as a member of one racial group behaves as a member of a different racial group – have become more easily accessible. This research uses media evidence of passing as a social practice to examine the personal motivations of the “passer” as well as the shifting public attitudes towards them. I draw on well-known examples from modern news, such as the cases of Rachel Dolezal and Michael Derrick Hudson, in order to analyze their contexts and portrayals in modern media. In addition, this research investigates occurrences of passing that have accrued historical renown, like those of Dr. Albert Johnston and Harry S. Murphy, in order to identify key themes in the re-telling of stories of passing. In this way the project will trace the historical arc of the discourses of racial passing in public culture.  In combining these two elements, this research aims to give a comprehensive overview of the shift in cultural attitudes that surrounds racial passing in the United States.. ""A Moral Judgement Comparison on Racial Passing: Villainy or Heroism?""

As human beings, we often make judgments on scenarios and situations instinctively, meaning that we may not necessarily be aware of the mechanisms of thought that lead us to sort actions into the socially “acceptable” versus “unacceptable” behavior groups. Racial passing – the act of representing yourself to be part of a racial group other than your own –  is one of the most heavily condemned acts in our society. Using two (2+) separate cases, this research explores the three-way relationship between the personal justification (that of the passer), the public justification (why others think they did it), and public reception (was it viewed as justified?). Using a variety of media archived news sources, I demonstrate what standards we use to methodically sort cases of racial passing into acts of “heroism” or “villainy”.. ""Descriptive Imagery: What Police Reports Teach Us about Perceptions of Race""

As we have learned from years of psychological research, the words we choose can sometimes reveal our underlying biases or influence our preexisting notions. It is fairly common in our society to see color terminology (e.g. “Black”, “White”) used to label races, and it has often been argued that employing color terms creates a duality that uses “White” and “Black” to frame prejudiced colloquialisms into “good” and “bad” categories. This research aims to investigate this bias by looking at the words that police use to describe people that they interact with in publicly accessible police reports. I then explore the societal impact that this wording has and theorize about the potential implications of the word choice..

Lot of fun learning and working with MIS, Syteline, Redmine (Project Management Tool), and various other technologies.. Graduate Student. Coding Dojo was a 14 weeks extensive Full Stack Development program where I decided to code for more than 70 hours per week. I have learned a lot since then. I was taught Python, .NET Core, Django, Flask, Ajax, jQuery, SQL, AWS server, and much more. Mid way through the program I was able to built a website powered by Python and Django and deploy it in AWS server successfully. My E-commerce Website can be the judge of that. At the almost end of the program i was able and built and deployed a game rating website using the IGDB API. This one was built using .NET Core, along with other front-end frameworks and plugins (also found in my Github, portfolio and the projects section in LinkedIn).. Game Developer. Without prior work experience in game development, I publish an android game in the Google Play Store using Unity3d.

Designed a shop feature and an Ad Service using Google AdMob.

Experience with Google Ad services, Mobile Optimization, Android development, Mobile UI/UX design.. Line Cook. Manage a team during closing operation. 

Delegates tasks whenever necessary, which result in a faster and cleaner closing.

Train and coordinates new employees which leads to a faster involvement..  This is my gem. This is where everything started. My first game ever using C# and Unity3d. I had a lot of fun doing this project, I learned about game design, game management, gamer retention strategy, animations, monetization using the Google and Unity3d Ad Service and a lot more. In short, this game was the cornerstone in my adventure in the tech industry. Also it is available in the Google Play Store.. The ChatBox was a group project. One of my fellow coding dojo classmate and I built this Facebook like App. We had a lot of fun building this one, especially when it came to the logic of the Like button, comments, the poke feature and the Ajax requests.. This project is a responsive game rating website where you can review your favorite games. Furthermore, it also help the user know which games are the most popular. This project was made possible by the IGDB API. It is a gaming api, where you can find pretty much everything about a game.. This responsive E-Commerce website was made using Django, Ajax, jQuery and Python. It also include an Admin page where you are able to analyze the orders you got, as well as putting new products in the website. I am very proud of this project, because it was something I did not know I would be able to do if you asked me 5 months ago.. A Book E-Commerce, implemented and built using React, Redux, Styled Component, HTML/CSS, CSS animation.

This is not a full E-Commerce website, only the important parts of an E-Commerce website is built. Meaning, 
    There is a cart, 
    A PayPal feature, 
    The UX/UI design of the overall website, 
    The calculation of the total price after and before taxes 
    The ability to increase the quantity of a product and see real time changes due to the awesomeness            of React. I built a simple Redmine App/plugin where you can upload multiple files with or without file attachments to your Redmine's Wiki Pages with just a simple Drag and Drop. And it has an awesome interface that I probably spent way too much time on. The App make use of the Ruby on Rails Framework, Redmine Rest API, HTML/CSS, a ton of jQuery and Stack ….

Ashley Rogers,1,0,7,6.48,0,1,1,0,0,0,"Ever since being given a book on MSWLogo at 7 in a flimsy attempt by my dad to get me out of his hair, I've been programming games. While my early attempts were fairly lackluster, I moved quickly to Python, to Game Maker, to Flash and AS3, and finally to Unity, leaving a trail of passionate attempts at entertainment media in my wake. At Becker College I was able to develop my skills with industry experience, working on several commercial mobile titles with MassDiGI. My crowning achievement at Becker, as far as I'm concerned, was CyberDrive 2077 - I developed this game from scratch with a team of six at MassDiGI SIP 2018, continued on as producer and lead programmer to take it to launch, and it went on to become one of our most successful titles in the history of MassDiGI, with thousands of players and a 4.7 star rating on the App Store. 

Since summer 2019, I've worked heavily with Dejobaan Games, the award-winning developers of Elegy for a Dead World, Monster Loves You!, and AaAaAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. I helped bring Twenty Minute Metropolis, a 3D city builder released in March 2019, to a procedurally-generated 2D isometric prototype of a sequel, Thirty Minute Metropolis. My shader expertise, refined in my work with 30MM, helped Dejobaan take their visual style for Last Night on Planet Earth from Photoshop mockups to realtime Unity scenes. I'm currently working on a remaster of AaAaAA!!!, Dejobaan's 2009 hit basejumping game, putting my graphics programming skills to the task of updating the visuals to pristine 2020 quality.

Since graduation, I've worked for Tricky Fast Studios, a Massachusetts-based contract development firm, providing development support to AAA game projects and sophisticated interactive products. In just a short period, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, in a variety of development situations. Bachelor of Arts (B.A.);  Software Engineer II. .

Worked in association with Dejobaan Games to develop Thirty Minute Metropolis, a city builder where you begin society anew after the apocalypse and build the biggest brightest city you can in thirty minutes. I was tasked with developing a 2D isometric engine to graft on to the previously-existing 3D game skeleton, writing a procedural generation algorithm to generate infinite new levels from scratch, and overhauling the game's systems to allow new mechanics to be implemented and old mechanics to be extended while working with our external partners at Dejobaan to guide the project's direction.. Video Game Programming Intern. Developing a multiplayer cooperative educational adventure for students about constructing the early universe.. Intern - SIP 2018. As associate producer and programmer on CyberDrive 2077, I worked in a team of six to rapidly develop and test several prototypes for potential games. Based on feedback from playtesters we decided which of the prototypes would be the most successful and spent the next two months developing our unique and interesting take on the endless runner genre.. Intern - Live Studio. Producer, Lead Programmer

I am interested in mixing raw physics and engineering with modern electronic instruments to turn standalone tools into platforms for probing cutting-edge physics.

I study graphene and 2D transition metal dichalcogenide physics at the picosecond time scale using custom, state-of-the-art terahertz and mm wave instrumentation. My interests are in..

(1) Quantum transport, incl. strongly-interacting systems, fractional quantum Hall and fractional Chern insulating states in graphene, and terahertz carrier dynamics in hydrodynamics graphene
(2) Twisted bilayer graphene physics
(3) THz and mm wave scale physics and instrumentation
(4) Topologically non-trivial physics. Development Engineer. As an analog/RF engineer, I work to develop microwave and analog measurement technologies for the purpose of characterizing novel solid state devices. Project work includes...

(1) Quasi-analytic and numerical broadband microwave and mm-wave design
(2) Wideband semiconductor (GaN and Ga2O3) device characterization
(3) Research of novel thermometric techniques and technologies. Research Assistant. . Applications Engineering Intern. . Undergraduate Research Assistant. . Hardware Engineering Intern. . Assistant Tennis Coach. .  FEH (Ohio State's honors 1st year engineering track) prepared a list of tasks to completed by an autonomous robot in two minutes. Engineering teams were given a microcontroller, machine shop access, and 10 weeks to deliver a functioning autonomous robotic device. I was responsible for writing and validating software, interfacing with electronic sensors, and testing the robot's functionality.. My responsibilities included controlling the operation of a high-speed RF modem, preparing a GUI for automated testing, and validating hardware functionality.. I analyze the metrological revolution spurred by the Quantum Hall Effect. The Classical Hall Effect describes the development of an electrical potential in a direction orthogonal to both applied electric and magnetic fields. Landau quantization and the formation of Landau levels leads to the quantum mechanical analogue: the (integer) Quantum Hall Effect. Quantized conductivity allows for metrologists to define conductivity (resitivity) in terms of fundamental units. The Quantum Hall Effect completes the metrological triangle, giving rise to ""perfectly invariant"" electrical standards.. We analyze the effects of atmospheric ducts on wave propagation over the sea. Atmospheric ducts greatly extend the radio horizon in parts of the X and S bands. Propagation through over-sea ducts depends strongly on chosen wave polarization, the atmosphere's humidity gradient, and sea roughness (among other parameters). Atmospheric ducts allow for useful ship-ship communications, but may present hazards to covert ship-satellite communications.. We engineered, built, and rigorously tested an RF disc golf tracking system as a senior capstone project. Our final product: a smartphone-controlled, lightweight (17g) module that fits under common disc golf discs that allows users to track lost discs at distances up to 65 feet in open fields. The device minimally perturbs the disc's flight path and can survive impacts of 60 mph with no decrease in performance.. Patch antennas represent one solution to the demand for transmitters for mobile communications. We analyze and optimize the geometry of a patch produce a maximum gain, maximum bandwidth, and minimum VSWR at 1800 MHz. Hand calculations and simulation show our optimized parameters produce a gain of 9.86 dB, bandwidth of 49 MHz, and VSWR of 1.07 at the resonant frequency.. Pairing magnetic hysteresis First Order Reversal Curves (FORCs) and the Preisach Model of hysteresis can be used to determine a sample's ""magnetic signature"" and study magnetic structure at the domain level. Processing a data to create a FORC diagram is numerically complicated and can be done in any number of styles. I developed FORC software in Python with previously undeveloped curve-fitting capabilities and verified its operation for a number of samples.. We design and measure an unconditionally stable 2 GHz pHEMT amplifier with microstrip transmission lines on an RT Duriod 5880 substrate. The amplifier was simulated in ADS, both with simple lumped circuit and finite element analysis. Simple microwave measurements reveal a gain of 17.7 dB and input reflection coefficient of -11.6 dB, surpassing our goals.. Planar Inverted-F Antennas (PIFAs), commonly used in cell phones, can be adapted to work at two bands by careful geometric consideration. A PIFA from literature was modified, modeled, and simulated in FEKO using the method of moments. We produce 3 dB bandwidths of 613 MHz and 892 MHz around center frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz respectively and show that the design may be adapted to a smartphone-sized ground plane.. We designed, assembled, and tested a 20-section approximate microstrip Klopfenstein taper on RT Duroid 5580 substrate. A Klopfenstein taper, the limit of an infinite-order Chebyshev transformer, was designed to be the optimal broadband matching circuit element for 1.5 - 2.0 GHz. The taper was designed by hand, simulated in ADS, fabricated, and tested. Our analysis extended beyond basic microwave measurements to residual error calculation and accurate measurements of the load impedance. Such analysis accurately predicted the load impedance within 2 mOhms, via three independent measurements..

In previous lab work I've published on neuroinflammation and novel approaches to tumor imaging and drug delivery, while my current work hopes to break into the immune therapy of myeloid malignancies by utilizing T-cell cytotoxicity facilitated by novel bi-functional proteins. I thrive at the lectern, or in recent years as the host of a Zoom meeting, when I get the chance to facilitate new learning and excitement in regards to science. Whether I'm presenting my own work, or teaching undergraduates fundamental courses, the opportunity to get into the minds of a diverse cohort of thinkers to deepen our understanding of modern science is precious to me. In giving lectures, journal club presentations, or thesis committee meetings, I love the opportunity to test my ability to foster an engaged understanding of the material-- the challenge of repackaging biology concepts to students with a wide range of background knowledge, or of justifying methods and data of my thesis work to experts in different disciplines, is exciting and rewarding. Bachelor’s Degree; Doctor of Philosophy (PhD);  Adjunct Associate. Teaching Adjunct for the Computing in Context course in Columbia's Department of Computer Science. I was previously a teaching assistant for this course in 2019 and 2020. In both roles, I have handled the Biology context, where students (with no requisite coding experience) use Python to simulate population changes and to map networks of gene- and protein-interactions. The course introduces the capabilities of coding with Python to students whose coursework might not otherwise incorporate coding at all. As a teaching assistant I had the chance to design assignments and rubrics, and I'm excited to take on the rest of the course as an instructor.. Teaching Assistant. As a teaching assistant in Chemistry Laboratory and Chemistry Laboratory Lecture courses, I helped students new to concepts of chemistry and new to lab work to get acquainted with the fundamentals. In the lecture, where students were introduced to concepts like acid-base interactions and coordination complexes, we utilized an Active Learning model where in-class collaborative participation built upon videos watched before class. In the laboratory, I led sections of 15-20 students in basic chemistry experiments, such as synthesis of aspirin. Outside of the classroom and lab, I held office hours and facilitated discussions online between students. The Spring 2020 semester was taught online.. PhD Candidate. My work focuses on novel immunotherapeutic approaches to acute myeloid leukemia and myeloid dysplastic syndrome, and is expected to be completed early 2022.

Postdoctoral Research Associate. During my postdoc, I have worked on SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes and have tried to find out the relationship, of this very important chromatin remodeling complex in the deadliest form of skin cancer i.e. Melanoma. For this, we concentrated on one very important BRAF mutation i.e. BRAF V600E which is responsible for promoting   epigenetic changes in melanomas. Our hypothesis was that BRAF (V600E) alters SWI/SNF function to promote the epigenetic changes that occur in melanoma.
 I have also worked on elucidating mechanisms by which microRNAs can regulate SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes in being responsible for the gene expression changes occurring under pathological hypertrophic conditions. For this we were using both in-vitro, primary cardiomyocytes from 1-2 day old rats and in-vivo models such as the Dahl/Rapp salt sensitive and resistant rats.. Junior Demonstrator/ Acting instructor.

Having this book read to me, ignited a sense of curiosity in me since I was little which has never died since.

Now how do I harness this curiosity?  I decided to focus my career in forensics engineering! Interweaving it with my interest in buildings and architecture, I specialise in understanding the root causes and mechanisms that lead to the failures of components and/or systems in the built environment.

Throughout my career, I have inspected over 300 distinct buildings, ranging from single-storey residential dwellings in the outback, to one of the highest residential apartment building in Australia.

The types of issues that I have diagnosed and repaired, includes the following (to name a few):

	- Interior and exterior waterproofing membranes
	- Combustible cladding
	- Building movements induced by reactive clay soils
	- Concrete reinforcement spalling 
	- Glazing elements
	- Lightweight cladding
	- Parking garages

I am not your regular engineer.  I'm a very visual person and love utilising sketches and diagrams to depict my ideas.  This includes hand-drawn details to computer models for clients and contractors alike.  I am naturally outgoing and have a high level of personal energy!  I love coordination, sharing experiences, and knowledge with others around me which makes me thrive in teams.   

When I am not crawling under buildings or hanging out the side of skyscrapers, I enjoy practicing and competing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cooking, and reading.

I love a good chat - so don't hesitate to reach out. Master of Engineering (M.Eng) in Building Engineering; Diploma of Science and Engineering; Bachelor of Engineering (BEng)(Hons);  Sr. Building Envelope Consultant. . Remedial Facade Engineer. -	Consulted and developed service proposals for property owners and managers of buildings Australia-wide.  I led the investigation of Sydney’s tallest residential building, reported and presented findings to clients, budgeted repair costs for capital planning.  I designed and tested repair methods, which was then implemented across the 77-storey structure.

-	Improved the quality of deliverables by implementing standardized project and proposal templates.  Reduced report turnaround time by programming a Python script to automate the insertion and formatting of photographs in site reports.  

-	Worked collaboratively with builders and their subcontractors in the delivery of new façade system installations.  Critically review façade shop drawings in a major to identify potential concerns in glazing and cladding systems.  By using hand-drawn sketches, 2D and 3D CAD details, I presented and improved the quality of the weatherproofing details in residential, commercial, and healthcare buildings.  

-	Planned and executed data collection to predict thermal comfort of a semi-outdoor atrium.  Developed a computer model of the building using SketchUp and DesignBuilder, to simulate design parameters on the building.  Present findings within a report and visual presentation to the client.

-	Managed and mentored junior team members in understanding the fundamentals of building engineering through presentations and on-site guidance.. Diagnostic Structural Engineer. Working on behalf of insurance companies, I inspected, diagnosed, and reported on the causes and extents of structural damage following storms, inundations, fires, earthquakes, and accidents.  
I utilised site evidence, first-principles, and structural modelling to back-engineer, or design new components within: low-rise residential dwellings, large industrial warehouses, in- and above-ground swimming pools, pergolas, retaining walls, amongst others.

Having identified Remotely Piloted Aircrafts (RPAs) as an emerging technology within the inspection space, I expanded the business service offering to include aerial inspections.  I developed and implemented Standard Operating Procedures and Company Policies and trained staff in the safe planning and operation of aerial inspections.  I undertook several missions, which included the inspection a large rural property damaged in landslide, and a large fire-damaged warehouse, whose access would have otherwise been difficult using traditional methods.. Remedial Engineer. I guided asset managers and property owners through the process of building renovation and remediation from start to finish. 

I identified and diagnosed key issues contributing to building defects in low- and high-rise construction.  Working collaboratively with material suppliers and contractors, I developed and executed the rehabilitation of structures involving: (to name a few)

	- Internal and external waterproofing
	- Concrete repairs
	- Steel coatings
	- Ancillary steel components
	- Masonry walls
	- Lightweight cladding
	- Paint coatings
	- Render
	- Windows

By applying my knowledge of the Australian National Construction Code and building contracts, I worked collaboratively within teams to identify, document, and report building issues for use in defects settlement, and litigation..

Aakash Kakadiya,1,0,7,3.65,0,1,1,0,0,0,"""Fill your life with experiences, not things. Have stories to tell, not stuff to show."" 

I am a fourth-year student at Rutgers - New Brunswick double majoring in Marketing & Business Analytics and Information Technology. I am seeking a role to apply my previous experience effectively. 

Previously, I interned at a school for students with Special Needs and completed a Capstone project that helped the students smile, one day at a time. In my free time, I am currently learning how to play the ukulele and I love to sing. As a member of my previous choir, I am thankful to have been able to accompany them in performing at Carnegie Hall in New York City and in Denmark. Also, the connections I made and skills I compiled as a Director of hackBCA are invaluable, and am proud to say I have joined the HackRU Team as Director of Finance as well! Working directly with sponsors, as well as managing the questionnaire email, budget sheet, contracts, and invoices lead to an entirely new world of hackathons. 

One of my favorite parts as Director of Finance and Legal Operations was managing my team to work out problems between team members, settling disputes with companies, and finalizing legal documents that helped create such a wonderful event. I feel lucky to have acquired comprehensive skills to help me in many aspects of life having been a coach and captain of Cricket and Volleyball teams.

The Capstone project that I worked on senior year of high school was an unforgettable experience. Our group of 5 created a working project that uses intensive Artificial Intelligence technology, and linked it to a Humanoid Robot to recognize special needs students and hold a lengthy conversation with them. Getting to know the students on a very personal level opened my eyes and provided me with a whole new perspective of the world.

* Student mentality when tackling anything data related 👨🏼‍🎓
* Wise among his years 👀
* Data modeling, engineering, and analysis 👓

I currently am a research analyst at Canterbury Consulting, and I have a passion for data science and anything analytics or data engineering-related. I write about some of my personal projects here: https://medium.com/@azaanbarlas

I have been interested in data analytics since 2018, being introduced through a mandatory business course I took about databases. I loved how challenging it was, so I ended up taking programming courses and learning about data science in my free time. 

I have extensive experience with Data Visualization as well and have done some automation in my recent work experiences. I love talking to people who are in this field, and I would love to learn more about how I can contribute positively to the world with these tools.

Aside from data analytics, I like learning about NFTs, as well as stocks and fixed-income. I also am a huge soccer nerd, especially in German and Italian soccer.

This project involved modules for costumers, sales and inventory. It was developed using PHP scripting language at the front end and MySQL at the back end. The system could handle day to day activities in a car showroom which would require database operations.. Designed and developed a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Used PHP to handle the data provided by various users and help make the website into a dynamic one. The website allowed readers to provide feedback on various articles which allowed the administrator to arrange articles based on content quality. It was built on a local host using the APACHE free hosting server.. The objective was to achieve maximum normalization while building a database which can be used for analysis and study by football enthusiasts. This project helped understand about query processing and optimization. The front end was built using Visual Basic and the back end was developed and managed using Oracle SQL server.. Developed a chat application which encrypts a message on the server end and then decrypts it before displaying at the client end. Socket programming technique was used to write the code in Java. This encryption and decryption was done by using the traditional Data Encryption Standard (DES).. The project aimed at building a CBIR engine which would provide highly accurate results when compared to existing systems while simultaneously improving upon the size of the database the system can handle and reducing the feature processing time. Proposed to combine the techniques which used color and shape features of the image. Implemented color based searching using Hue Min Max Difference color space to quantize colors of an image and shape based searching using the Edge Histogram Descriptor which allowed comparing edge features of the images. The final system could process 2000 images in approximately 1 hour 6 minutes with an average efficiency of 70% while generating 20 results for a search query. The project was implemented using MATLAB..

Associate Quantitative Reasearch. . Graduate Research Assistant. . Quantitative Specialist  Intern. . Engineering Summer Intern. Worked on formulating two modules; a model predictive control scheme and a second module that            computed a move plan in manipulated variables (MV) so that the plant can reach a maximum profit state using an optimiser on Matlab.
- Working on the predictive model algorithm gave me a great insight into data management and number crunching (involved analysing the effects of numerous variable and their effects on the output). 
- The second module comprised of programming an optimiser with constraints based on demand-supply trends speculated by market analysts. These trends were then incorporated to derive a move plan in the variables, so as to run the whole plant at its most economically optimum state.
- The project gave me a perspective of how the risks associated in demand and supply are integrated with control theory using optimisation. 
- Offered a pre- placement offer to work full time at Reliance.. Project Trainee. Worked on simulating the dynamics of a system of multivariate second order, non-linear differential equations (dynamics were of oscillatory nature). It involved studying the effects of 9 parameters (variables) on the resultant behaviour of the equations. 
- In the first stage of the project a stability analysis was carried out wherein an optimum region of stability was identified, where the oscillations were stable and convergent in nature.
- In the second stage of the project a parameter testing was applied to the equation to determine the parameters that had the most dominant effect on the oscillatory dynamics of the equation.. Project Trainee. Studied the degradation of Triazophos (pesticide), a high level pollutant in run-off water. The aim of the project was to use Hydrodynamic Cavitation and analyse how the degradation kinetics of Triazophos change with change in the surrounding parameters. 
- The first step was to vary the parameters in the experiment, parameters such as operating pressure, temperature, velocity of fluid flow, pH of solution, etc. The purpose of this step was to collect various samples of the solution to generate a data set which could then be analysed to get a comprehensive degradation equation.
- In the second stage the data collected was then analysed and filtered, after which an equation for the degradation kinetics was generated using regression analysis. Furthermore, the optimum working conditions in which the experiment should be carried out were determined.
- This experience gave me great insight into data analysis and optimisation as well as the technical knowledge of using various Chemical Engineering equipments such as HPLC, Gas Chromatography and TOC..  Formulated a python program to extract real-time market data from Yahoo Finance; employed the Markowitz Theory and single index models on NIFTY (market index) and blue chip stocks; extended the code to explore their validity in modern day markets. • Analyzed the shape of the front wing and various parameters such as angle of attack, area of the wing, etc. and optimized their  value for the running of the car. 				     
• Manually solved the Navier Strokes partial differential equations around the wing, developed a velocity profile and studied the  pressure gradient required to achieve the downward force needed to maintain stability of the car’s motion.. • Studied an Effluent Treatment plant and analysed the effect of automation on the energy efficiency of the process. 
• With the help of numbers it was found that automation required a higher procurement price, but when viewed over a 20 year  timescale, resulted in a 35% decrease in the energy cost and a 47% reduction in the GHG emissions.. • Critical paper review to critique the study discussed in the paper on the stability of interacting process control loops. 
• The paper caters to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems; and derives a stability region for a PI control system in terms  of control parameters. 
• Here I learnt how to analyse a system of equations that are interactive in nature. The dynamics of on mathematical equation influences the dynamics of the other mathematics equation.. • Analysed a balance sheet of a chemical firm and speculated its financial health by studying, financial ratios, Debt, Profits, etc.. • Studied the nuclear fuel cycle and the structural and microstructure properties of spent nuclear fuel and its associated hazards. 
• Cost and risk assessment of the various options that can be used for the treatment of spent nuclear fuel. 
• Researched the two options of managing spent nuclear fuel, either reprocessing it using various chemical processes such as extraction, pyrolysis, etc. or disposing it off in the earths crust till it is radioactively benign.. • Simulated a model predictive control scheme to study the inputs in present time to predict outputs in future time.

Part of a teaching team for Code in Place, offered by Stanford during COVID-19 pandemic, with 10,000 global students and 900 volunteer teachers participating from around the world.

Prepared and taught a weekly discussion section of 10-12 students to supplement professors’ lectures in a 5-week introductory online Python programming course based on material from the first half of Stanford’s introductory programming course, CS106A..

Community Lead/ Developer Relations. Working to develop and strengthen the Zededa and LF Edge (EVE) developer community.. d-shop Global Director/ Developer Advocate. The d-shop is SAP's internal Community and Maker-space. We started in 2013 and grew it from 5 locations to now over 35 world wide on 5 continents. 

The mission of d-shop is to bring external and internal technologies closer to all SAP employees and to expand our cross silo community engagement within SAP.  These technologies vary widely from IoT to Machine Learning to AR/VR.  We bring these technologies to life by teaching hands on projects.

The d-shop serves as a great way to demonstrate to our customers and to the community the innovation side of SAP, with over 1,000 customer visits a month.  Plus, the d-shop enables our colleagues to go out into the the community and teach introduction to coding to the next generation of software engineers.

As Global Director, I managed the focus of the d-shop program, setting priorities, evangelizing SAP technologies and evangelized new technologies coming into SAP; managed our core staff and the over 100 volunteers from around the world; created and taught new content; and reached out to external partners to bring new technology into SAP.

Created and spoke at our ""d-shop days"" events, where we invited our colleague to come and learn some of the latest technologies that they will be using over the next one to five years.  This event attracted over 500 of our colleagues at each of our 15 stops.  Aaron also did multiple train the trainer sessions to train our local d-shop staff. 

Named a SAP Catalyst (top performer).. Lead- d-shop Americas. The d-shop (developer workshop) is SAP's internal maker-space.  We started in 2013 and now have 21 d-shops world wide.  I am the lead for the Americas and Australia.

The mission of d-shop is to bring external technologies closer to all SAP employees.

We do this by removing the barriers that stand in the way of trying non-SAP technologies hands-on at SAP:
Selection: we bring to SAP external technologies that are relevant, exciting and easy to start with.
Cost and process: we purchase the hardware and make it available informally and free of charge for all.

Getting started: we know enough about each technology to get any colleague started.
Time: we schedule activities so that colleagues do not have to take time off their project to attend.

How does this benefit SAP?
Innovation: we enable colleagues on a breadth of technologies early on in their adoption cycle.
Employee engagement: coming to d-shop makes SAP employees happy and more engaged!
“Build bridges, not silos”: connect colleagues across teams and locations
Branding: we change the perception of the SAP brand to one that is more innovative, approachable and open to the world.. Product Manager- SAP Hana Cloud Platform- Internet of Things- (IoT). Working with partners and customers, we develop IoT solutions on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform.  
Focusing on the Americas and APJ (Asia, Pacific, and Japan).

Projects start as just an idea and we work with our partners and customers to develop those ideas starting with design thinking sessions.  Here we can flush out many different ideas by using personas.  Those personas guide us on how the end user would use the product.
From that we work with the development team to develop the product, on a very short time line using Agile methodology.  Then release a new version every 3 months, always working with the partners and customers, to validate the current release and get new feedback for the next.

During my time at SAP, I have worked with people, of different backgrounds and cultures, from around the world.  I have always looked for the common ground and have included as many people as possible in the process.. Speaking/ Teaching Events. SAP d-shop days, World Wide

Modelling and Simulation : Simulink, Simscape Multibody, CARLA Simulator, CADEM SeeNC Turn/Mill Bachelor of Technology; Masters;  Embedded Systems Engineer. • Researched and Implemented White Rabbit Synchronization protocol using combination of Precise Timing Protocol (PTP) for time synchronization, Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) for frequency syntonization and Digital Dual Mixer Time Difference (D-DMTD) for phase synchronization on FPGAs (Xilinx MPSoC ZCU102/111) on Verilog/HLS.
• At this Indegeneous 5G Testbed at IIT-Madras, India, we achieved subnanosecond levels of synchronization between BaseBand Unit (BBU) & Remote Radio Head (RRH) which are connected via a 100 meter optical communication link.. Embedded System Developer. • Developed system for Dead Reckoning Localization of e-bikes using low-powered sensor suite of Inertial Measurement Unit and Magnetic Encoder, implemented on STM32 Nucleo-64 (ARM Cortex-M3) MCU.
• Bike’s location data accurate up to 5m was transmitted through an onboard GSM module to the nearest service station upon request or when the e-bike is reported stolen through the app interface.. Embedded System Programmer. • Implemented an improved multi-master SPI communication protocol using a dynamic master-select logic enabling the master to control the data bus without contention to broadcast messages.
• Achieved deterministic communication time even with increase in number of devices in the network by avoiding Daisy Chaining using the master-select board.. Robotics Programmer. • Programmed a modular semi-autonomous “Frisbee Launching” robot for ABU Robocon 2017 on a modified “T” Differential Drive mechanism to enable lateral translation of the system. The Launcher module is interfaced with the Drive mechanism through UART.
• Developed an Autonomous Mobile “Eco” Robot powered by Wind energy supplied by another Semi-Autonomous “Hybrid” Robot. The Eco-bot harnessed power using regenerative braking. It also featured an ambient light resistant line following algorithm..  ● Built a Spherical Wheel enclosing three orthogonally placed flywheels driven by BLDCs for achieving
CMG actuation to control the movement of the wheel in all directions.. ● Constructed a low-weight Knee Exoskeleton with a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) mechanism. A
high-speed BLDC is coupled with a torsional spring through a timing-belt mechanism to enable transfer
of torque to the human knee through a spring energy buffer.
● SEA is used so that the system has back-drivability - the knee can still move independently to a certain
degree and is not constrained by the mechanism mounted. Due to this property, the torque output on
the human side is more easily measured.
● To implement Zero Impedance Control, the system is modelled by bode-plotting and System Identification Toolbox in MATLAB and simulated via Simscape Multibody.. ● Implemented LQR control algorithm for automated lane keeping during gameplay (Grand Theft Auto)
through frame-by-frame image recognition.
● Screenshots of gameplay were taken at 25 FPS which was processed using Hough Line Transformation
for detecting lanes and feedback for steering is sent to the game interface using win32 library.. ● Simulations of various pre-crash scenarios of automated vehicles are crafted in the CARLA simulation
environment to arrive at safety metrics that will be vital in standardising the industry and ensuring safe
development and commercialisation of these technologies.
● Various IAM Safety Metrics (like Time-To-Collision, Post-Encroachment-Time, ...) are extracted from the
simulation data and analyzed to conclude if they are helping in quantifying the safety of an Automated
Vehicle. Thresholds for each metric are arrived at which the vehicle’s driving is considered as safe..
